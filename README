Orca 0.1.0

Introduction
========================================================================

Orca a scriptable screen reader that is currently under development.
As such it is highly unstable and undergoes frequent changes.  To
read more about Orca, please refer to the "Programmer's Guide" in 
the docs/programmers-guide directory.


Build Requirements
========================================================================

Building Orca requires the following to be installed:

	* Python 2.3         - Python platform
	* pyorbit 2.0.1      - Python bindings for ORBit2
	* pygtk 2.4.1        - GTK+ Python bindings
	* gnome-python 2.6.2 - Python bindings for various GNOME libraries
	* gnome-speech 0.3.0 - GNOME speech synthesis services
	* gnome-mag 0.11.14  - GNOME screen magnification services (note 
			       that Orca builds find without gnome-mag,
			       but magnification will not work)
	* BRLTTY 3.6.1       - Braille support (note that Orca builds fine
	                       without BRLTTY installed, but Braille support 
                               will work without it)
	* at-spi 1.6.2       - GNOME assistive technology framework
                               NOTE: need a patch to at-spi/libspi/accessible.c
			       for GEdit and Evolution to work without crashing
			       or hanging.


Overview
========================================================================

One of the biggest challenges in screen reading technology is providing a
consistant user experience across multiple applications which may use objects
in different ways, and to allow quick access to information which may not be
easily accessible through an application's keyboard navigation commands.  Orca
is an initial attempt to explore how to solve some of these difficulties.
Some common scenarios which Orca's script-based architecture would be suited
to solve:

* An application which displays text of interest to the user in a
  non-focusable object

* Create hot keys to be used in certain applications to collect and read
  various pieces of information

* Causing the Braille display to show status information retrieved from status
  bars or other objects in the application

Orca is written in Python and C.  Orca's low-level connection to the at-spi is
a Python module written in C, and the upper-level logic is entirely written in
Python.  Orca defines a set of default behaviors (reactions to application
events) and key bindings (reaction to user key presses).  These default
behaviors and key bindings can be overwritten on a per-application basis.
Orca creates a script object for each running application, which merges both
the default behaviors and key bindings, and the application specific ones.
Orca provides the infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well
as a host of services accessible from within the scripts.  Some of these
services include:

* A speech module which provides named voices which are definable by the user,
  and a subsystem for reading long documents called the "Say All" system

* A Braille module which uses BRLTTY to provide high-level Braille services to
  scripts - these services include Braille keyboard callback support,
  software-based virtual regions for the Braille display, and scrolling
  management

* Convenience functions for finding the labels of objects, getting all the
  objects within a given object, etc.


Initial Setup
========================================================================

Before running orca, you should run orca-setup.  Orca-setup creates a
.orca directory in your home directry.  This directory stores your
user settings, as well as any scripts which you use that are not part
of the default Orca installation.
