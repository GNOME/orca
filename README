Scripting test bed for screen reading.

Build Requirements
==========
Building Orca requires the following to be installed:
	* Python version 2.2 or 2.3
	* pyorbit - Python bindings for ORBit2
	* pygtk - GTK+ Python bindings
	* gnome-python - Python bindings for various GNOME libraries
	* Recent version of at-spi
	* gnome-speech version 0.3.0 or greater
	* BRLTTY 3.5 for Braille support (note that Orca builds fine
	  without BRLTTY installed, but Braille support will work)

Overview
==========
One of the biggest challenges in screen reading technology is
providing a consistant user experience across multiple applications
which may use objects in different ways, and to allow quick access to
information which may not be easily accessible through an
application's keyboard navigation commands.  Orca is an initial
attempt to explore how to solve some of these difficulties.  Some
common scenarios which Orca's script-based architecture would be
suited to solve:

* An application which displays text of interest to the user in a
  non-focusable object
* Create hot keys to be used in certain applications to collect and
  read various pieces of information
* Causing the Braille display to show status information retrieved
  from status bars or other objects in the application

Orca Overview
==========
Orca is written in Python and C.  Orca's low-level connection to the
at-spi is a Python module written in C, and the upper-level logic is
entirely written in Python.  Orca defines a set of default behaviors
(reactions to application events) and key bindings (reaction to user
key presses).  These default behaviors and key bindings can be
overwritten on a per-application basis.  Orca creates a script object
for each running application, which merges both the default behaviors
and key bindings, and the application specific ones.  Orca provides the
infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well as a host
of services accessible from within the scripts.  Some of these
sservices include:
	* A speech module which provides named voices which are
	  definable by the user, and a subsystem for reading long documents
	  called the "Say All" system
	* A Braille module which uses BRLTTY to provide high-level
	  Braille services to scripts - these services include Braille keyboard
	  callback support, software-based virtual regions for the Braille
	  display, and scrolling management
	* Convenience functions for finding the labels of objects,
	  getting all the objects within a given object, etc.

Initial Setup
==========
Before running orca, you should run orca-setup.  Orca-setup creates a
.orca directory in your home directry.  This directory stores your
user settings, as well as any scripts which you use that are not part
of the default Orca installation.
