<p>We don't want to get stuck on images that are also links.</p>
<a href="whatever.html">Here's a link
<br><img src="bar.gif" alt="" border="0" height="5" width="1">
</a>
<br>
<a href="blah.html">Here's another
<br><img src="foo.gif" alt="" border="0" height="5" width="1">
</a>
<p>Why do pages get marked up this way???</p>
