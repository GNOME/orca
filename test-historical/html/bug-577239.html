<title>Test Page for HTML List Items</title>
</head><body>
<p>
this is a page to test how well Orca works with list items.
</p>

<p>
this is an ordered list: 

</p><ol>
<li>
This is a short list item.
</li>
<li> 
This is a list item that spans multiple lines. If Orca can
successfully read to the end of this list item, it will have read
several lines of text within this single item. And, yes, I realize
that this is not deathless prose. In fact, it is prose that should
probably be put out of its misery.
</li> 
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>
This is an example of an unordered list: 

</p><ul>
<li>
This is a short list item.
</li>
<li> 
This is a list item that spans multiple lines. If Orca can
successfully read to the end of this list item, it will have read

</li> 
</ul>
