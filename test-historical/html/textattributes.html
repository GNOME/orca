  <h2>From Shakespeare's Hamlet</h2>
  <p align="left">I have of late but<br>
  wherefore I know not lost all my mirth,<br>
  forgone all custom of exercises;<br>
  and indeed, it goes so heavily with<br>
  my disposition that this goodly frame,<br>
  the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory;<br>
  this most excellent canopy, the air, look you,<br>
  this brave o'erhanging firmament,<br>
  this majestical roof fretted with golden fire<br>
  why, it appeareth no other thing to me than a foul<br>
  and pestilent congregation of vapours.<br>
  What a piece of work is a man!<br>
  how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties!<br>
  in form and moving how express and admirable!<br>
  in action how like an angel!<br>
  in apprehension how like a god!<br>
  the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals!</p>

  <h1>Indent</h1>

  <h2>From Wislawa Szymborska - 1972</h2>

  <blockquote>I am a tranquilizer. <br>
  I am effective at home, <br>
  I work well at the office, <br>
  I take exams, <br>
  I appear in court, <br>
  I carefully mend broken crockery - <br>
  all you need do is take me, <br>
  dissolve me under the tongue, <br>
  all you need do is swallow me, <br>
  just wash me down with water.

  <p>I know how to cope with misfortune, <br>
  how to endure bad news, <br>
  take the edge of injustice, <br>
  make up for the absence of God, <br>
  help pick out your widow's weeds. <br>
  What are you waiting for - <br>
  have faith in chemistry's compassion. </p>

  <p>You're still a young man/woman, <br>
  you really should settle down somehow. <br>
  Who said <br>
  life must be lived courageously? </p>

  <p>Hand your abyss over to me - <br>
  I will line it up with soft sleep, <br>
  you'll be grateful for <br>
  the four-footed landing. </p>

  <p>Sell me your soul. <br>
  There's no other buyer likely to turn up. </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There's no other devil left.<br>
