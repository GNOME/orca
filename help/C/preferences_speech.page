  <section id="enable_speech">
    <title>Enable speech</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Enable speech</gui> check box controls whether or not
      <app>Orca</app> will make use of a speech synthesizer.
      Braille-only users will likely want to uncheck this checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: checked
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="verbosity">
    <title>Verbosity</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Verbosity</gui> setting determines the amount of information
      that will be spoken in various situations. For example, if it is set
      to verbose, and you arrow into a word that is misspelled, <app>Orca</app>
      will announce that the word is misspelled. When the level is set to brief,
      this announcement will not be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: <gui>Verbose</gui>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="table_rows">
    <title>Table Rows</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Table Rows</gui> radio button group determines what gets
      spoken when navigating amongst rows in a table. The available
      options are <gui>speak row</gui> and <gui>speak cell</gui>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the process of examining the list of messages in your Inbox.
      In order to have <app>Orca</app> announce the sender, subject, date,
      and presence of attachments you would need <gui>speak row</gui>. On
      the other hand, when navigating amongst rows in a spreadsheet, hearing
      the full row may not be desired. In that case, <gui>speak cell</gui>
      should instead be chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: <gui>Speak row</gui>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="punctuation_level">
    <title>Punctuation Level</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Punctuation Level</gui> radio button group is used to
      adjust the amount of punctuation spoken by the synthesizer. The
      available levels are <gui>None</gui>, <gui>Some</gui>, <gui>Most</gui>,
      and <gui>All</gui>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: <gui>Most</gui>
    </p>
    <section>
      <title>None</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>None</gui> would, as you expect,
        cause no punctuation to be spoken. Note, however, that special symbols
        such as subscripted and superscripted numbers, unicode fractions, and
        bullets are still spoken at this level, even though some might consider
        these types of symbols punctuation.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Some</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>Some</gui> causes all of the
        previously-mentioned symbols to be spoken. In addition, <app>Orca</app>
        will speak known mathematical symbols, currency symbols, and "^", "@",
        "/", "&amp;", "#".
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Most</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>Most</gui> causes all of the
        previous-mentioned symbols to be spoken. In addition, <app>Orca</app>
        will speak all other known punctuation symbols <em>other than</em> "!",
        "'", ",", ".", "?".
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>All</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>All</gui>, as expected, causes
        <app>Orca</app> to speak all known punctuation symbols.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="spoken_context">
    <title>Spoken Context</title>
    <p>
      The following items control the presentation of a variety of
      supplemental, "system" information about the item with focus.
      Because the associated text does not appear on screen, this
      information is presented in <app>Orca</app>'s System voice.
    </p>
    <section id="only_speak_displayed_text">
      <title>Only speak displayed text</title>
      <p>
        Checking this checkbox causes <app>Orca</app> to only speak actual
        text displayed on screen. This option is intended primarily for low
        vision users and users with a visual learning disability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked
      </p>
      <note style="note">
        <p>
          The follow items will not be available for configuration if

    <section id="speak_blank_lines">
      <title>Speak blank lines</title>
      <p>
        If the <gui>Speak blank lines</gui> checkbox is checked,
        <app>Orca</app> will say "blank" each time you arrow to a blank
        line. If it is unchecked, <app>Orca</app> will say nothing when
        you move to a blank line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="indentation_and_justification">
      <title>Speak indentation and justification</title>
      <p>
        When working with code or editing other documents it is often
        desirable to be aware of justification and indentation. Checking
        the <gui>Speak indentation and justification</gui> checkbox will
        cause <app>Orca</app> to announce this information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="mnemonics">
     <title>Speak object mnemonics</title>
      <p>
        If the <gui>Speak object mnemonics</gui> checkbox is checked,
        <app>Orca</app> will announce the mnemonic associated with the
        object with focus (such as <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>O</key>
        </keyseq> for an <gui>OK</gui> button).
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="child_position">
      <title>Speak child position</title>
      <p>
        Checking the <gui>Speak child position</gui> checkbox will cause
        <app>Orca</app> to announce the position of the focused item in
        menus, lists, and trees (e.g. "9 of 16").
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="speak_tutorial_messages">
      <title>Speak tutorial messages</title>
      <p>
        If the <gui>Speak tutorial messages</gui> checkbox is checked, as
        you move amongst objects in an interface, <app>Orca</app> will
        provide additional information, such as how to interact with the
        currently-focused object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="system_messages_are_detailed">
      <title>System messages are detailed</title>
      <p>
        If <gui>System messages are detailed</gui> is checked, <app>Orca</app> will
        present detailed messages to you in speech. For instance, if you use
        <app>Orca</app>'s command to change key echo, <app>Orca</app> might
        speak "Key echo set to word." If you would prefer shorter messages,
        such as simply "word," you should uncheck this checkbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="speak_colors_as_names">
      <title>Speak colors as names</title>
      <p>
        If <gui>Speak colors as names</gui> is checked, <app>Orca</app> will
        describe colors, looking for the closest approximate. For instance,
        RGB 0, 27, 51 would be spoken as "midnight blue." If you would prefer
        to hear the exact RGB value, you should uncheck this checkbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: checked

    <section>
      <title>Restrict to</title>
      <p>
         This combo box allows you to control which progress bars should be
         presented, assuming the presentation of progress bar updates has been
         enabled. The choices are <gui>All</gui>, <gui>Application</gui>, and
         <gui>Window</gui>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing <gui>All</gui> will result in <app>Orca</app> presenting
        updates for all progress bars, regardless of where the progress bars
        are located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing <gui>Application</gui> will result in <app>Orca</app>
        presenting updates from progress bars in the active application, even
        if they are not in the active window.
      </p>
      <p>
         Choosing <gui>Window</gui> will result in <app>Orca</app> only
         presenting updates for progress bars in the active window.
