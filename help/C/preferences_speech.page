    <title>Enable speech</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Enable speech</gui> check box controls whether or not
      <app>Orca</app> will make use of a speech synthesizer.
      Braille-only users will likely want to uncheck this checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: checked
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="verbosity">
    <title>Verbosity</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Verbosity</gui> setting determines the amount of information
      that will be spoken in various situations. For example, if it is set
      to verbose, and you arrow into a word that is misspelled, <app>Orca</app>
      will announce that the word is misspelled. When the level is set to brief,
      this announcement will not be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: <gui>Verbose</gui>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="punctuation_level">
    <title>Punctuation Level</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Punctuation Level</gui> radio button group is used to
      adjust the amount of punctuation spoken by the synthesizer. The
      available levels are <gui>None</gui>, <gui>Some</gui>, <gui>Most</gui>,
      and <gui>All</gui>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default value: <gui>Most</gui>
    </p>
    <section id="punctuation_level_none">
      <title>None</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>None</gui> would, as you expect,
        cause no punctuation to be spoken. Note, however, that special symbols
        such as subscripted and superscripted numbers, Unicode fractions, and
        bullets are still spoken at this level, even though some might consider
        these types of symbols punctuation.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="punctuation_level_some">
      <title>Some</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>Some</gui> causes all of the
        previously-mentioned symbols to be spoken. In addition, <app>Orca</app>
        will speak known mathematical symbols, currency symbols, and "^", "@",
        "/", "&amp;", "#".
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="punctuation_level_most">
      <title>Most</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>Most</gui> causes all of the
        previous-mentioned symbols to be spoken. In addition, <app>Orca</app>
        will speak all other known punctuation symbols <em>other than</em> "!",
        "'", ",", ".", "?".
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="punctuation_level_all">
      <title>All</title>
      <p>
        Choosing a punctuation level of <gui>All</gui>, as expected, causes
        <app>Orca</app> to speak all known punctuation symbols.

  <section id="spoken_context">
    <title>Spoken Context</title>
    <p>
      The following items control the presentation of a variety of
      supplemental, "system" information about the item with focus.
      Because the associated text does not appear on screen, this
      information is presented in <app>Orca</app>'s System voice.
    </p>
    <section id="only_speak_displayed_text">
      <title>Only speak displayed text</title>
      <p>
        Checking this checkbox causes <app>Orca</app> to only speak actual
        text displayed on screen. This option is intended primarily for low
        vision users and users with a visual learning disability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked
      </p>
      <note style="note">

      <p>
        If the <gui>Speak blank lines</gui> checkbox is checked,
        <app>Orca</app> will say "blank" each time you arrow to a blank
        line. If it is unchecked, <app>Orca</app> will say nothing when
        you move to a blank line.
      </p>

    <section id="indentation_and_justification">
      <title>Speak indentation and justification</title>
      <p>
        When working with code or editing other documents it is often
        desirable to be aware of justification and indentation. Checking
        the <gui>Speak indentation and justification</gui> checkbox will
        cause <app>Orca</app> to announce this information.

      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="speak_misspelled_word_indicator">
      <title>Speak misspelled-word indicator</title>
      <p>
        The misspelled-word indicator is the red squiggly line that appears
        underneath misspelled words in editable text fields. If <gui>Speak
        misspelled-word indicator</gui> is checked, when you navigate into
        a word with this indicator, or type a word incorrectly causing this
        indicator to appear, <app>Orca</app> will speak "misspelled."

     <title>Speak object mnemonics</title>
      <p>
        If the <gui>Speak object mnemonics</gui> checkbox is checked,
        <app>Orca</app> will announce the mnemonic associated with the
        object with focus (such as <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>O</key>
        </keyseq> for an <gui>OK</gui> button).
      </p>

    <section id="child_position">
      <title>Speak child position</title>
      <p>
        Checking the <gui>Speak child position</gui> checkbox will cause
        <app>Orca</app> to announce the position of the focused item in
        menus, lists, and trees (e.g. "9 of 16").

    <section id="speak_tutorial_messages">
      <title>Speak tutorial messages</title>
      <p>
        If the <gui>Speak tutorial messages</gui> checkbox is checked, as
        you move amongst objects in an interface, <app>Orca</app> will
        provide additional information, such as how to interact with the
        currently-focused object.

      <title>Speak description</title>
      <p>
        If the <gui>Speak description</gui> checkbox is checked, as
        you move amongst objects in an interface, <app>Orca</app> will
        speak the accessible description in addition to the accessible
        name of the object.

        Default value: checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="system_messages_are_detailed">
      <title>System messages are detailed</title>
      <p>
        If <gui>System messages are detailed</gui> is checked, <app>Orca</app> will
        present detailed messages to you in speech. For instance, if you use
        <app>Orca</app>'s command to change key echo, <app>Orca</app> might
        speak "Key echo set to word." If you would prefer shorter messages,
        such as simply "word," you should uncheck this checkbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="speak_colors_as_names">
      <title>Speak colors as names</title>
      <p>
        If <gui>Speak colors as names</gui> is checked, <app>Orca</app> will
        describe colors, looking for the closest approximate. For instance,
        RGB 0, 27, 51 would be spoken as "midnight blue." If you would prefer
        to hear the exact RGB value, you should uncheck this checkbox.
