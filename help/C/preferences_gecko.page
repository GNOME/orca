    <title>Page Navigation</title>
    <p>
      The <gui>Page Navigation</gui> group of controls make it possible for you
      to customize how <app>Orca</app> presents, and allow you to interact with,
      text and other content.

    <section id="page_navigation_control_caret">
      <title>Control caret navigation</title>
      <p>
        This checkbox toggles <app>Orca</app>'s caret navigation on and off.
        When it is on, <app>Orca</app> takes control of the caret as you arrow
        around within a page; when it is off, Gecko's native caret navigation is
        active.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: checked
      </p>
      <note style="tip">
        <title>This setting can be toggled on the fly</title>
        <p>
          To toggle this setting on the fly without saving it, use
          <keyseq><key>Orca Modifier</key><key>F12</key></keyseq>.

    <section id="page_navigation_focus_caret">
      <title>Automatic focus mode during caret navigation</title>
      <p>
        If this checkbox is checked, <app>Orca</app> will automatically turn on
        focus mode when you use caret navigation commands to navigate to a form
        field. For example, pressing <key>Down</key> would allow you to move
        into an entry but once you had done so, Orca would switch to focus mode
        and subsequent presses of <key>Down</key> would be controlled by the web
        browser and not by Orca. If this checkbox is not checked, <app>Orca</app>
        would continue to control what happens when you press <key>Down</key>,
        thus making it possible to arrow out of the entry and continue reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked

      <note style="tip">

          In order to start or stop interacting with the focused form field,
          use <keyseq><key>Orca Modifier</key><key>A</key></keyseq> to switch
          between browse mode and focus mode.

        This checkbox toggles <app>Orca</app>'s
        <link xref="howto_structural_navigation">Structural Navigation</link>
        on and off. Structural Navigation allows you to navigate by elements
        such as headings, links, and form fields.

        If this checkbox is checked, <app>Orca</app> will automatically turn on
        focus mode when you use structural navigation commands to navigate to a
        form field. For example, pressing <key>E</key> to move to the next entry
        would move focus there and also turn focus mode on so that your next press
        of <key>E</key> would type an "e" into that entry. If this checkbox is not
        checked, then <app>Orca</app> will leave you in browse mode and your next
        press of <key>E</key> would move you to the next entry on the page.

        If this checkbox is checked, <app>Orca</app>'s caret navigation will respect
        the on-screen layout of the content and present the full line, including any
        links or form fields on that line. If this checkbox is not checked, <app>Orca</app>
        will treat objects such as links and form fields as if they were on separate

          If this checkbox is checked, <app>Orca</app> will not present the
          matching line if it is the same line as the previous match. This
          option is designed to prevent "chattiness" on a line with multiple
          instances of the string for which you are searching.

        This editable spin button is where you can specify the number of
        characters which much match before <app>Orca</app> announces the
        matching line. This option is also designed to prevent "chattiness"
        as there are many matches when you first begin typing the string
        for which you are searching.
