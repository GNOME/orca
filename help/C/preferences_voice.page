        This combo box makes it possible for you to use different voices so that
        you can better distinguish uppercase and linked text from other text,
        and on-screen text from text added by <app>Orca</app>.

        <p>
          For each voice you wish to configure, first select the
          voice in the <gui>Voice type</gui> combo box. Then
          configure the person, rate, pitch, and volume to be used
          for that voice.

        This combo box allows you to select your preferred speech system from
        those you have installed, such as Speech Dispatcher.

      <title>Person</title>
      <p>
        This combo box allows you to choose which "person" or "speaker" should
        be used with the selected voice. For instance, you might wish to have
        David speak by default, but have hyperlinks spoken by Alice. Note that
        what you find in the <gui>Person</gui> combo box will depend on which
        speech synthesizers you have installed.

      <p>
       This combo box allows you to choose which Speech Dispatcher capitalization
       indication styles you wish to use in addition to <app>Orca</app>'s
       capitalization voice. The options, which are named using Speech Dispatcher's
       terminology, are:
     </p>
     <list>
       <item><p><gui>Icon</gui>: Plays a tone</p></item>
       <item><p><gui>Spell</gui>: Speaks the word "capital"</p></item>
       <item><p><gui>None</gui></p></item>
    </list>
    <note style="tip">
      <title>This setting can be toggled on the fly</title>
      <p>
        <app>Orca</app> also has a command to cycle through the available
        capitalization styles. See <link xref="commands_speech_settings">
        Speech Settings Commands</link> for more information.

      <title>Break speech into chunks between pauses</title>
      <p>
        Depending on the enabled speech settings, <app>Orca</app> may have quite
        a bit to say about a particular object such as its name, its role, its
        state, its mnemonic, its tutorial message, and so on. Checking the
        <gui>Break speech into chunks between pauses</gui> checkbox will cause
        <app>Orca</app> to insert brief pauses in between each of these pieces
        of information.
      </p>

        Default value: checked

    <section id="multicase_strings">
      <title>Speak multicase strings as words</title>
      <p>
        In some text, and especially when working with code, one often comes
        across a "word" consisting of several words with alternating case, such
        as "MultiCaseString." Speech synthesizers do not always pronounce such
        multicase strings correctly. Checking the <gui>Speak multicase strings
        as words</gui> checkbox will cause <app>Orca</app> to break a word like
        "MultiCaseString" into separate words ("Multi," "Case," and "String")
        prior to passing it along to the speech synthesizer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Default value: not checked
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="numbers_as_digits">
      <title>Speak numbers as digits</title>
      <p>
        Checking the <gui>Speak numbers as digits</gui> checkbox will cause
        <app>Orca</app> to break a number like "123" into separate digits
        ("1," "2," and "3") prior to passing it along to the speech synthesizer.
      </p>

        Default value: not checked
