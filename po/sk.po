#. Translators: When presenting the content of a line on a web page, Orca by
#. default presents the full line, including any links or form fields on that
#. line, in order to reflect the on-screen layout as seen by sighted users.
#. Not all users like this presentation, however, and prefer to have objects
#. treated as if they were on individual lines, such as is done by Windows
#. screen readers, so that unrelated objects (e.g. links in a navbar) are not
#. all jumbled together. As a result, this is now configurable. If layout mode
#. is enabled, Orca will present the full line as it appears on the screen; if
#. it is disabled, Orca will treat each object as if it were on a separate line,
#. both for presentation and navigation. This string is associated with the Orca
#. command to manually toggle layout mode on/off.

msgid "Toggle layout mode"
msgstr "Prepnúť vzhľad ako na obrazovke v režime prehliadania"

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to manually switch
#. between these two modes.

#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be
#. a navigation command to move amongst entries.

#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser
#. and not by Orca. If this setting is not enabled, Orca would continue to control

#. Translators: Orca has a sleep mode which causes Orca to essentially behave as

#. as speech and braille. In the latter case, we want to ensure that Orca's
#. commands and speech/braille do not interfere with that of the VM and any
#. screen reader being used in that VM. Thus when an application is being used
#. in sleep mode, nearly all Orca commands become unbound/free, and nothing is
#. spoken or brailled. But if the user toggles sleep mode off or switches to
#. another application window, Orca commands, speech, and braille immediately

#. Translators: (Please see the previous, detailed translator notes about
#. Focus mode and Browse mode.) In order to minimize the amount of work Orca
#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which

#. Translators: Orca normal speaks the text which was just inserted into a

#. due to having been restored (e.g. the user selected text, deleted it,
#. and then pressed Ctrl+Z to undo that deletion). In this instance, Orca

#. Translators: Orca has a sleep mode which causes Orca to essentially behave as
#. if it were not running for a given application. Some use cases include self-
#. voicing apps with associated commands (e.g. ChromeVox) and VMs. In the former
#. case, the self-voicing app is expected to provide all needed commands as well
#. as speech and braille. In the latter case, we want to ensure that Orca's
#. commands and speech/braille do not interfere with that of the VM and any
#. screen reader being used in that VM. Thus when an application is being used
#. in sleep mode, nearly all Orca commands become unbound/free, and nothing is
#. spoken or brailled. But if the user toggles sleep mode off or switches to
#. another application window, Orca commands, speech, and braille immediately
#. resume working. This string is the message Orca presents when sleep mode is
#. disabled by the user. The string substitution is the name of the application.

#. Translators: Braille flash messages are similar in nature to notifications or announcements. They are most commonly used for Orca to communicate Orca-specific information to the user via braille, such as confirming the toggling of an Orca setting via command. The reason they are called flash messages by screen readers is that they are shown on the refreshable braille display for only a brief time, after which the original contents of the display are restored. This label is for the spin button through which a user can customize how long (in seconds) these temporary messages should be displayed.

#. Translators: this is a structure to assist in the generation of

#.
#. It is a simple structure that consists of pairs of

#. letter : word(s)
#.
#. where the letter and word(s) are separate by colons and each
#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:
#.
#. a : alpha, b : bravo, c : charlie,
#.
#. And so on.  The complete set should consist of all the letters from
#. the alphabet for your language paired with the common
#. military/phonetic word(s) used to describe that letter.
