#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default

#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be
#. a navigation command to move amongst entries.

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior

#. Orca doesn't know what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca
#. treats key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats

#. move into an entry but once you had done so, Orca would switch to Focus mode
#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser
#. and not by Orca. If this setting is not enabled, Orca would continue to control

#. Translators: In chat applications, Orca automatically presents incoming
#. messages in speech and braille. If a user is in multiple conversations or
#. channels at the same time, it can be confusing to know what room or channel
#. a given message came from just from hearing/reading it. For this reason, Orca
#. has an option to present the name of the room first ("#a11y <joanie> hello!"
#. instead of "<joanie> hello!"). This string to be translated is presented when
#. the value of the setting is toggled.

#. Translators: Orca has a command to review previous chat room messages in

#. (e.g. the last ten messages which came in, no matter what room they came
#. from). Other users prefer to have specific room history (e.g. the last ten
#. messages from #a11y). Therefore, this is a setting in Orca. This string to be

#. Translators: This string is associated with a combo box which allows the user to select the set of symbols to be used when Orca presents print strings on a refreshable braille display. Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille contractions get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for ing (dots 3-4-6), and the letter e (dots 1-5) all by itself represents the word every. The list of rules which dictate what contractions should be used and whether or not they can be used in a particular context are stored in tables provided by liblouis.

They are most commonly used for Orca to communicate Orca-specific information to the user via braille, such as confirming the toggling of an Orca setting via command. The reason they are called flash messages by screen readers is that they are shown on the refreshable braille display for only a brief time, after which the original contents of the display are restored. This label is for the spin button through which a user can customize how long (in seconds) these temporary messages should be displayed.

#. Translators: Braille flash messages are similar in nature to notifications or announcements.

The reason they are called flash messages by screen readers is that they are shown on the refreshable braille display for only a brief time, after which the original contents of the display are restored. Some users, however, would prefer to have the message remain displayed until they explicitly dismiss it. This can be accomplished by making flash messages persistent by checking this checkbox.

#. Translators: this is a structure to assist in the generation of

#. letter : word(s)
#.
#. where the letter and word(s) are separate by colons and each
#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:
#.
#. a : alpha, b : bravo, c : charlie,
