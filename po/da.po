# I oversættelsen af farver har jeg bevidst valgt at skrive lys grøn i stedet for lysegrøn, fordi det gør det nemmere og symmetrisk når der skal oversættes sådan noget som "pale green" at det så kan gøres til bleg grøn. Ligeledes har jeg undladt at tilføje "-farvet" på alle den ting som er opkaldt efter en blomst, et dyr eller tilsvarende idet jeg antager at farvekonteksten er implicit.
#
# I forbindelse med oversættelse af MathML ligninger har jeg lagt vægt på at de
# skal være nemme at forstå/visualisere. Det går nogle gange ud over
# sproget. F.eks. er "fraction start" ikke, som måske ville være pænere dansk,
# oversat til "start af brøk" men til "brøk start", med start og slut til
# sidst. Det er gjort for at det skal være nemmere at skelne hvornår man rent
# faktisk starter på det omtalte objekt.
#
# scootergrisen: venter på gennemlæsning af orca-help så jeg kan komme videre med orca
# scootergrisen: speak speaking spoken er indtil videre oversat til sig sige
# scootergrisen: tjek til sidst om sig skal ændres til oplæs - læs ... op

#. Translators: When presenting the content of a line on a web page, Orca by

#. Not all users like this presentation, however, and prefer to have objects
#. treated as if they were on individual lines, such as is done by Windows
#. screen readers, so that unrelated objects (e.g. links in a navbar) are not
#. all jumbled together. As a result, this is now configurable. If layout mode
#. is enabled, Orca will present the full line as it appears on the screen; if
#. it is disabled, Orca will treat each object as if it were on a separate line,
#. both for presentation and navigation. This string is associated with the Orca
#. command to manually toggle layout mode on/off.
#: src/orca/cmdnames.py:1025
msgid "Toggle layout mode"
msgstr "Layouttilstand til/fra"

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to manually switch

#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which

#. Translators: This string appears on a button in a dialog. "Activating" the

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be
#. a navigation command to move amongst entries.

#. move into an entry but once you had done so, Orca would switch to Focus mode
#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser
#. and not by Orca. If this setting is not enabled, Orca would continue to control
#. what happens when you press an arrow key, thus making it possible to arrow out

Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille contractions get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for ing (dots 3-4-6), and the letter e (dots 1-5) all by itself represents the word every.

#. Translators: this is a structure to assist in the generation of

#. bravo charlie'.
#.
#. It is a simple structure that consists of pairs of
#.
#. letter : word(s)
#.
#. where the letter and word(s) are separate by colons and each
#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:
#.
#. a : alpha, b : bravo, c : charlie,
#.
#. And so on.  The complete set should consist of all the letters from
#. the alphabet for your language paired with the common
#. military/phonetic word(s) used to describe that letter.
