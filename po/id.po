#. messages from #a11y). Therefore, this is a setting in Orca. This string to be

msgid "Toggle whether we provide chat room specific message histories."

#. messages in speech and braille. If a user is in multiple conversations or
#. channels at the same time, it can be confusing to know what room or channel
#. a given message came from just from hearing/reading it. For this reason, Orca
#. has an option to present the name of the room first ("#a11y <joanie> hello!"
#. instead of "<joanie> hello!"). This string to be translated is associated with

#. Translators: A live region is an area of a web page that is periodically

#. idle ("polite"), and when there is a change ("assertive"). Orca has several

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.

#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior

#. Orca doesn't know what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca

#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser
#. and not by Orca. If this setting is not enabled, Orca would continue to control

#. comma is inserted here to cause a very brief pause in the speech. Otherwise,

#. of 9, root end" (assuming the user settings indicate that root endings should
#. be spoken). Note that the radicand, which follows the "of", is unknown and

#. Translators: This phrase is spoken to inform the user that what is about to

msgid "root of"
msgstr "akar dari"

#. Translators: This phrase is spoken to inform the user that what is about to

#. It is primarily intended to be spoken when the index of the root is not a
#. simple expression. For instance, for the fourth root of 9, simply speaking
#. "fourth root of 9" may be sufficient for the user. But if the index is not
#. 4, but instead the fraction x/4, beginning the phrase with "root start" can
#. help the user better understand that x/4 is the index of the root.

Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille contractions get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for ing (dots 3-4-6), and the letter e (dots 1-5) all by itself represents the word every.

#. Translators: this is a structure to assist in the generation of

#. bravo charlie'.
#.
#. It is a simple structure that consists of pairs of
#.
#. letter : word(s)
#.
#. where the letter and word(s) are separate by colons and each
#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:
#.
#. a : alpha, b : bravo, c : charlie,
#.
#. And so on.  The complete set should consist of all the letters from
#. the alphabet for your language paired with the common
#. military/phonetic word(s) used to describe that letter.
#.
#. The Wikipedia entry
