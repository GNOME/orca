#. Translators: Orca has a sleep mode which causes Orca to essentially behave as

#. case, the self-voicing app is expected to provide all needed commands as well
#. as speech and braille. In the latter case, we want to ensure that Orca's
#. commands and speech/braille do not interfere with that of the VM and any
#. screen reader being used in that VM. Thus when an application is being used
#. in sleep mode, nearly all Orca commands become unbound/free, and nothing is
#. spoken or brailled. But if the user toggles sleep mode off or switches to
#. another application window, Orca commands, speech, and braille immediately

#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.

#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

#. Translators: "Present Unless" is a column header of the text attributes panel
#. of the Orca preferences dialog. On this panel, the user can select a set of
#. text attributes that they would like spoken and/or indicated in braille.
#. Because the list of attributes could get quite lengthy, we provide the option
#. to always speak/braille a text attribute *unless* its value is equal to the
#. value given by the user in this column of the list. For example, given the
#. text attribute "underline" and a present unless value of "none", the user is
#. stating that he/she would like to have underlined text announced for all cases
#. (single, double, low, etc.) except when the value of underline is none (i.e.
#. when it's not underlined). "Present" here is being used as a verb.

#. Translators: Orca has a sleep mode which causes Orca to essentially behave as

#. voicing apps with associated commands (e.g. ChromeVox) and VMs. In the former
#. case, the self-voicing app is expected to provide all needed commands as well
#. as speech and braille. In the latter case, we want to ensure that Orca's
#. commands and speech/braille do not interfere with that of the VM and any
#. screen reader being used in that VM. Thus when an application is being used
#. in sleep mode, nearly all Orca commands become unbound/free, and nothing is
#. spoken or brailled. But if the user toggles sleep mode off or switches to
#. another application window, Orca commands, speech, and braille immediately
#. resume working. This string is the message Orca presents when sleep mode is

They are most commonly used for Orca to communicate Orca-specific information to the user via braille, such as confirming the toggling of an Orca setting via command. The reason they are called flash messages by screen readers is that they are shown on the refreshable braille display for only a brief time, after which the original contents of the display are restored.
