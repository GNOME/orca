#. for gettext support
#. Translators: this is a structure to assist in the generation of

#.
#. It is a simple structure that consists of pairs of

#. letter : word(s)
#.
#. where the letter and word(s) are separate by colons and each
#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:
#.
#. a : alpha, b : bravo, c : charlie,

#. And so on.  The complete set should consist of all the letters from
#. the alphabet for your language paired with the common
#. military/phonetic word(s) used to describe that letter.
