#. Translators: When presenting the content of a line on a web page, Orca by
#. default presents the full line, including any links or form fields on that
#. line, in order to reflect the on-screen layout as seen by sighted users.
#. Not all users like this presentation, however, and prefer to have objects
#. treated as if they were on individual lines, such as is done by Windows
#. screen readers, so that unrelated objects (e.g. links in a navbar) are not
#. all jumbled together. As a result, this is now configurable. If layout mode
#. is enabled, Orca will present the full line as it appears on the screen; if
#. it is disabled, Orca will treat each object as if it were on a separate line,
#. both for presentation and navigation. This string is associated with the Orca
#. command to manually toggle layout mode on/off.
#: src/orca/cmdnames.py:1133
msgid "Toggle layout mode"
msgstr "Commuta al mode de disposició"

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to manually switch
#. between these two modes.
#: src/orca/cmdnames.py:1149
msgid "Switch between browse mode and focus mode"
msgstr "Commuta entre el mode de navegació i el mode de focus"

#. Translators: (Please see the previous, detailed translator notes about
#. Focus mode and Browse mode.) In order to minimize the amount of work Orca
#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to enable sticky focus mode.

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser
#. and not by Orca. If this setting is not enabled, Orca would continue to control

#. Translators: Orca has a sleep mode which causes Orca to essentially behave as

#. voicing apps with associated commands (e.g. ChromeVox) and VMs. In the former
#. case, the self-voicing app is expected to provide all needed commands as well
#. as speech and braille. In the latter case, we want to ensure that Orca's
#. commands and speech/braille do not interfere with that of the VM and any
#. screen reader being used in that VM. Thus when an application is being used
#. in sleep mode, nearly all Orca commands become unbound/free, and nothing is
#. spoken or brailled. But if the user toggles sleep mode off or switches to
#. another application window, Orca commands, speech, and braille immediately

#. would say "fraction start, x+1 over y+2, fraction end."
#: src/orca/messages.py:1072
msgid "fraction start"
msgstr "inici de fracció"

#. Translators: This phrase is spoken to inform the user that what is about to

#. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination for an example. Note that the
#. comma is inserted here to cause a very brief pause in the speech. Otherwise,

#. of 9, root end" (assuming the user settings indicate that root endings should
#. be spoken). Note that the radicand, which follows the "of", is unknown and
#. might not even be a simple string; it might be the square root of another

#. Translators: This phrase is spoken to inform the user that what is about to

#. say "cube root of 9, root end" (assuming the user settings indicate that root
#. endings should  be spoken). Note that the radicand, which follows the "of",

msgid "root of"
msgstr "arrel de"

#. Translators: This phrase is spoken to inform the user that what is about to
#. be said is part of a mathematical root (square root, cube root, nth root).
#. It is primarily intended to be spoken when the index of the root is not a
#. simple expression. For instance, for the fourth root of 9, simply speaking
#. "fourth root of 9" may be sufficient for the user. But if the index is not
#. 4, but instead the fraction x/4, beginning the phrase with "root start" can
#. help the user better understand that x/4 is the index of the root.
#: src/orca/messages.py:1126
msgid "root start"

#. Translators: Orca has a sleep mode which causes Orca to essentially behave as

#. voicing apps with associated commands (e.g. ChromeVox) and VMs. In the former
#. case, the self-voicing app is expected to provide all needed commands as well
#. as speech and braille. In the latter case, we want to ensure that Orca's
#. commands and speech/braille do not interfere with that of the VM and any
#. screen reader being used in that VM. Thus when an application is being used
#. in sleep mode, nearly all Orca commands become unbound/free, and nothing is
#. spoken or brailled. But if the user toggles sleep mode off or switches to
#. another application window, Orca commands, speech, and braille immediately
#. resume working. This string is the message Orca presents when sleep mode is

#. Translators: Orca uses Speech Dispatcher to present content to users via text-to-speech. Speech Dispatcher has a feature to control how capital letters are presented: Do nothing at all; say the word 'capital' prior to presenting a capital letter (which Speech Dispatcher refers to as 'spell'), or play a tone (which Speech Dispatcher refers to as a sound 'icon'). Orca refers to these things as 'capitalization style'. This string is the text of the label through which users can choose which of style they would prefer.

Translators: Having multiple voice types in Orca makes it possible for the user to more quickly identify properties of text non-visually, such as the fact that text is written in capital letters or is a link; or that text is actually visible on the screen as opposed to an Orca-specific message. The available voice types in Orca include: default, uppercase, hyperlink, and system -- each of which can be configured by the user to sound the way he/she finds most helpful.

#. Translators: This string is associated with a combo box which allows the user to select the set of symbols to be used when Orca presents print strings on a refreshable braille display. Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille contractions get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for ing (dots 3-4-6), and the letter e (dots 1-5) all by itself represents the word every. The list of rules which dictate what contractions should be used and whether or not they can be used in a particular context are stored in tables provided by liblouis.
