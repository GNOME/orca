#. for gettext support
#. Translators: this is a structure to assist in the generation of
#. spoken military-style spelling.  For example, 'abc' becomes 'alpha
#. bravo charlie'.
#.
#. It is a simple structure that consists of pairs of
#.
#. letter : word(s)
#.
#. where the letter and word(s) are separate by colons and each
#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:
#.
#. a : alpha, b : bravo, c : charlie,
#.
#. And so on.  The complete set should consist of all the letters from
#. the alphabet for your language paired with the common
#. military/phonetic word(s) used to describe that letter.
#.
#. The Wikipedia entry
#. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet has a few
#. interesting tidbits about local conventions in the sections
#. "Additions in German, Danish and Norwegian" and "Variants".
