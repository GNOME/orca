#. Translators: When presenting the content of a line on a web page, Orca by
#. default presents the full line, including any links or form fields on that
#. line, in order to reflect the on-screen layout as seen by sighted users.
#. Not all users like this presentation, however, and prefer to have objects
#. treated as if they were on individual lines, such as is done by Windows
#. screen readers, so that unrelated objects (e.g. links in a navbar) are not
#. all jumbled together. As a result, this is now configurable. If layout mode
#. is enabled, Orca will present the full line as it appears on the screen; if
#. it is disabled, Orca will treat each object as if it were on a separate line,
#. both for presentation and navigation. This string is associated with the Orca
#. command to manually toggle layout mode on/off.
#: src/orca/cmdnames.py:1025
msgid "Toggles layout mode."
msgstr "Togol mod bentangan."

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to manually switch
#. between these two modes.
#: src/orca/cmdnames.py:1041
msgid "Switches between browse mode and focus mode."
msgstr "Tukar antara mod layar dengan mod fokus."

#. Translators: (Please see the previous, detailed translator notes about
#. Focus mode and Browse mode.) In order to minimize the amount of work Orca
#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to enable sticky focus mode.

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be
#. a navigation command to move amongst entries.

#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser
#. and not by Orca. If this setting is not enabled, Orca would continue to control

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or

#. Translators: This string is associated with a combo box which allows the user to select the set of symbols to be used when Orca presents print strings on a refreshable braille display. Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille contractions get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for ing (dots 3-4-6), and the letter e (dots 1-5) all by itself represents the word every. The list of rules which dictate what contractions should be used and whether or not they can be used in a particular context are stored in tables provided by liblouis.
