#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

#. Translators: Orca has a Say All feature which speaks the entire document. Normally, pressing any key will interrupt Say All presentation. However, if structural navigation is enabled for Say All, users can use commands such as H/Shift+H to jump to the next/previous heading, P/Shift+P to jump to the next/previous paragraph, T/Shift+T to jump to the next/previous table, and so on. Thus this setting is like fast forward and rewind, but with semantic awareness for web documents and similar content.

There are currently two choices (supplied by a combo box to the right of this label): say all by sentence and say all by line.  If Orca were speaking a work of fiction, it would probably be best to do say all by sentence so it sounds more natural. If Orca were speaking something like a page of computer commands, doing a say all by line would work better.
