#. Translators: When presenting the content of a line on a web page, Orca by

#. treated as if they were on individual lines, such as is done by Windows
#. screen readers, so that unrelated objects (e.g. links in a navbar) are not
#. all jumbled together. As a result, this is now configurable. If layout mode
#. is enabled, Orca will present the full line as it appears on the screen; if
#. it is disabled, Orca will treat each object as if it were on a separate line,
#. both for presentation and navigation. This string is associated with the Orca

#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.

#. to always speak/braille a text attribute *unless* its value is equal to the
#. value given by the user in this column of the list. For example, given the

#. stating that he/she would like to have underlined text announced for all cases
#. (single, double, low, etc.) except when the value of underline is none (i.e.

#. Translators: Orca has a sleep mode which causes Orca to essentially behave as

#. as speech and braille. In the latter case, we want to ensure that Orca's
#. commands and speech/braille do not interfere with that of the VM and any
#. screen reader being used in that VM. Thus when an application is being used
#. in sleep mode, nearly all Orca commands become unbound/free, and nothing is

#. Translators: This string is associated with a combo box which allows the user to select the set of symbols to be used when Orca presents print strings on a refreshable braille display. Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille contractions get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for ing (dots 3-4-6), and the letter e (dots 1-5) all by itself represents the word every. The list of rules which dictate what contractions should be used and whether or not they can be used in a particular context are stored in tables provided by liblouis.
