#. Translators: When presenting the content of a line on a web page, Orca by
#. default presents the full line, including any links or form fields on that
#. line, in order to reflect the on-screen layout as seen by sighted users.
#. Not all users like this presentation, however, and prefer to have objects
#. treated as if they were on individual lines, such as is done by Windows
#. screen readers, so that unrelated objects (e.g. links in a navbar) are not
#. all jumbled together. As a result, this is now configurable. If layout mode
#. is enabled, Orca will present the full line as it appears on the screen; if
#. it is disabled, Orca will treat each object as if it were on a separate line,
#. both for presentation and navigation. This string is associated with the Orca
#. command to manually toggle layout mode on/off.

msgstr "रूपरेखा मुद्रा"

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default
#. behavior within an application. For instance, on a web page, "h" moves
#. you to the next heading. What should happen when you press an "h" in
#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to manually switch
#. between these two modes.

#. Translators: (Please see the previous, detailed translator notes about
#. Focus mode and Browse mode.) In order to minimize the amount of work Orca
#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.

#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser

#. Translators: "Present Unless" is a column header of the text attributes panel
#. of the Orca preferences dialog. On this panel, the user can select a set of
#. text attributes that they would like spoken and/or indicated in braille.
#. Because the list of attributes could get quite lengthy, we provide the option
#. to always speak/braille a text attribute *unless* its value is equal to the
#. value given by the user in this column of the list. For example, given the
#. text attribute "underline" and a present unless value of "none", the user is
#. stating that he/she would like to have underlined text announced for all cases
#. (single, double, low, etc.) except when the value of underline is none (i.e.
#. when it's not underlined). "Present" here is being used as a verb.

#. Translators: Unicode has a large set of characters consisting of a common
#. alphanumeric symbol and a style. For instance, character 1D400 is a bold A,
#. 1D468 is a bold italic A, 1D4D0 is a bold script A,, etc., etc. These styles
#. can have specific meanings in mathematics and thus should be spoken along

#. Translators: (Please see the previous, detailed translator notes about

#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.

#. Translators: When presenting the content of a line on a web page, Orca by

#. screen readers, so that unrelated objects (e.g. links in a navbar) are not
#. all jumbled together. As a result, this is now configurable. If layout mode

#. Translators: Say all by refers to the way that Orca will say (speak) an amount of text -- in particular, where Orca where insert pauses. There are currently two choices (supplied by a combo box to the right of this label): say all by sentence and say all by line.  If Orca were speaking a work of fiction, it would probably be best to do say all by sentence so it sounds more natural. If Orca were speaking something like a page of computer commands, doing a say all by line would work better.

For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for ing (dots 3-4-6), and the letter e (dots 1-5) all by itself represents the word every.
