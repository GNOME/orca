#. Customized role pronunciations
#. User settings
#. Keyboard hooks
#. Speech support
#. Braille support
#. Orca i18n
#. The following functions present various types of objects - all
#. presentation functions handle both speech and Braille.  All
#. functions take the object as the first parameter, and a boolean
#. specifying whether the object had focus already or not
#. Present menus - This function speaks the menu item which current is
#. selected, an updates the Braille display to show all menu items with
#. the cursor under the currently selected item.  The object passed as
#. the first parameter is a menu item or a menu.
#. Put the menu on the Braille display - Put each menu item in its
#. own region on the Braille display
#. Put the Braille cursor under the selected item
#. Put the text on the Braille display
#. Speak the selected menu item
#. Present a page tab list - This function displays the page tab list
#. on the Braille display and speaks the currently selected page tab,
#. and puts the Braille cursor under the currently selected page tab.
#. the object passed to this function as the first parameter is the
#. currently selected page tab.
#. Put each page tab in its own region on the Braille display
#. Put the Braille cursor under the currently selected page tab
#. Put the text on the display
#. Speak the currently selected page tab
#. this function displays an object containing text on the Braille
#. display - It takes the Accessible object and retrieves the
#. AccessibleText interface, since it may also need access to the
#. object's label
#. If we're not using Braille, bail out now!
#. If this is the child of a combo box, use the combo boxe's label
#. Get the the AccessibleText interrface
#. Get the line containing the caret
#. Line is actually a list of objects-- the first is the actual
#. text of the line, the second is the start offset, and the third
#. is the end offset
#. Sometimes we get the trailing line-feed-- remove it
#. The label and text each get their own region - The label region
#. size is the length of the label's text + 1 or half the display
#. length, whidhever is less
#. Subtract the space that is left for us to use on the display
#. Make the advance keys scroll the region containing the text
#. Position the cursor at the caret position - Note that the region
#. containing the text can be longer than the physical display, and
#. tthat the cursor position is specified as an offset from the
#. beginning of the text
#. Post the text to the display
#. Speak the line of an AccessibleText object which contains the caret
#. Get the AccessibleText interface of the provided object
#. Spaek the word containing the caret
#. Speak the character under the caret
#. Present a text object - This displays the line containing the caret
#. on the Braille display, and speaks the line containing the caret
#. with speech
#. Update the Braille display
#. Present a combo box in speech and Braille
#. See if this combo box  has a text object in it
#. Put the combo box's label, if any, in it's own region on the
#. Braille display
#. The region containing the label should be the length of the
#. label's text +1 or half the display length, whichever is
#. smaller
#. If the bomxo box has a text object, display it in the combo
#. box's content region of the Braille display
#. Make the advance keys scroll the content region
#. Otherwise, the combo box's name will contain it's value -
#. display that in the combo box's content region on the Braille
#. display
#. Present a table object for speech and Braille - This function speaks
#. and Brailles the name and role of the table, and then speaks and
#. Brailles the selected items in the table
#. Only speak the table's name if it didn't already have focus
#. Get the accessible table interface of the object
#. Get the selected rows of the table
#. Add the text of all the selected cells together
#. If the cell has children, get a list of them
#. Otherwise, just make a list with the cell itelf as the
#. only member
#. Add the text of all the cells to the text string to be
#. displayed/spoken
#. Put each line of text in the cell in it's own
#. region on the Braille display, so there is
#. tactile separation between them
#. Put the text on the Braille display
#. Present a checkbox - This function displays ( ) and the object's
#. name on the display.  An x between the ( and ) indicates that the
#. checkbox is checked.  It also sppeaks the name of the object and
#. whether it is checked or unchecked
#. Get the state of the checkbox
#. If the checkbox is checked, indicate this in speech and Braille
#. If it's not already focused, say it's name
#. Present a radio button - This function is essentially the same as
#. the checkbox presenter, except that it attempts to find the
#. radio button's group
#. Find group
#. Put the group name and the radio button's label each in their
#. own region
#. If the radio button's label is too long to fit in it's region,
#. make the advance keys scroll that radio button name region
#. Present a button - Displays the button name on the Braille display
#. and speaks it
#. Presenter which is used if we don't have a role specific one
#. Speak and Braille the object's label and role
#. Present a dialog box - This function displays the name of the dialog
#. on the Braille display.  It speaks the title of the dialog.  It
#. then searches the dialog for labels which are not associated
#. with any other objects, and reads their contents
#. Find all the labels in the dialog
#. Add the names of only those labels which are not associated with
#. other objects (I.E., do empty relation setss)
#. This hash table maps role names to the above presenter functions
#. This function gets called whenever an object gets focus
#. Do we have a role specific presenter for this type of object
#. Nope, use the default
#. This function is called whenever a toplevel window is activated
#. Do we have a role specific presenter for this type of object?
#. This hash table defines which presenters should be used if an
#. object's selection changes
#. This function is called if an object's selection changes
#. See if we have an object specific presente registered to be
#. called when this type of object's selection changes
#. Don't do anything if we don't have a role-specific presenter
#. This hash table defines the presenters which should be called when
#. various states change for various types of objects.  The only
#. current example is that this table defines that the
#. checkBoxPresenter function should be called when the CHECKED state
#. changes on an object of role "checkbox"
#. This function is called whenever an object's state changes - Note
#. that currently, state changes for non-focused objects are ignored
#. Don't notify for state changes for non-focussed objects
#. Should we re-present the object?
#. WE found a notifier - is the state that just changed in our
#. list?
#. We're supposed to notify the user about this state change - do
#. we have a presenter for this type of object
#. This function is called whenever the caret moves
#. Update the Braille display
#. If this move is in response to an up or down arrow, read the line
#. Control-left and control-right arrows speak the word under the
#. caret
#. Right and left arrows speak the character under the cursor
#. This function is called whenever text is inserted into an object
#. Ignore text insertions to non-focused objects, unless the
#. currently focused object is the parent of the object to which
#. text was inserted
#. This function is called whenever text is deleted from an object
#. Ignore text deletions from non-focused objects, unless the
#. currently focused object is the parent of the object from which
#. text was deleted
#. The any_data member of the event object has the deleted text in
#. it - If the last key pressed was a backspace or delete key,
#. speak the deleted text
#. Quit the screen reader
#. The following functions handle Braille key presses from the display
#. - These functions receive an object to which the keypress was
#. directed, the region number which generated the key press, and the
#. offset of the key within the region
#. Handle Braille key presses directed at menus
#. Each menu item/menu displayed is in its own region - so the
#. region_num will indicate which menu/menu item to select
#. Get the AccessibleAction interface and do the first one
#. This function is called when Braille keys are directed at page tabs
#. Each page tab will be displayed in its own region of the Braille
#. display - so the region number will indicate the page tab to
#. select
#. Select the clicked page tab
#. This function is called when Braille keypresses are directed at text
#. objects
#. The line containing the caret is displayed on the display - so
#. the content region of the Braille display that generated the
#. keypress contains that line.  Therefore, the absolute offset to
#. move the caret to can be derived by the offset of the key plus the
#. offset of the beginning of the line containing the caret
#. This hash table defines the Braille key handlers for the various types
#. of objects
#. This function is called whenever a cursor key is pressed on the
#. Braille display
#. Clear the Braille display memory (does not clear the physical
#. disply)
#. Do we have a Braille key handler for the role of the focused
#. object?
#. We don't have a specific handler - see if the focused object
#. has an AccessibleAction interface, and if so, do the first
#. action it lists
#. The following functions related to the sayAll system - This system
#. is designed to be pluggable such that sayAll commands could be
#. implemented for various types of objects.  The current
#. implementation only works for reading the text of single text
#. objects.  This implementation will need to be extended to support
#. reading of more complex documents such as web pages in Yelp/Mozilla,
#. and documents within StarOffice
#. sayAllText contains the AccessibleText object of the document
#. currently being read
#. sayAllPosition is the current position within sayAllText
#. Get the next line of text to read
#. If the line is empty (which only happens at the end of the
#. document), quit.  Note that blank lines are returned as lines
#. of length 1 character which is the newline character
#. Speak the line
#. Set the say all position to the beginning of the line being read
#. Return true to continue reading
#. This function is called when sayAll mode is interrupted - the only
#. parameter is the position within the current chunk where speech
#. was interrupted
#. Move the caret to the position where speech was interrupted
#. This function initiates say all mode
#. If the focused object isn't text, we don't know how to read it
#: src/orca/default.py:834
msgid "Not a document."
msgstr "Kein Dokument."

#. Setup say all mode
#. Start reading at the caret offset
#. Start say all by speaking the current line - the end of speech
#. marker which occurs when this call to say is finished will cause
#. the say all process to continue
#. Initiate say all mode with the speech subsystem - providing the
#. sayAllGetChunk and sayAllStopped callbacks

#. References to the text input and output areas
#. If we've found a chat window, set a global reference to it and read
#. it
#. The chat window has threee text boxes in it (the chat topic, the
#. message log, and the text entry field).  find them all - they're
#. always returned in the same order
#. Speak the title of the chat
#: src/orca/gaim.py:55
msgid " chat"
msgstr "Chat"

#. When we've found an instant mesage window, keep a reference to it
#. There are two text boxes in each IM window (the message log, and
#. the text entry field).  They are always returned in the same
#. order
#. The first entry is the output log
#. Speak the title of the IM
#: src/orca/gaim.py:81
msgid " instant message"
msgstr " Sofortmitteilung"

#. This function is called whenever one of Gaim's toplevel windows is
#. activated
#. If it's not a standard window, do the normal behavior since it
#. won't have an IM or chat in it
#. Frames with two text boxes are considered to be instant message
#. dinwos, and those with three are considered chats.  This works for
#. now, but we need a more robust way of doing this sort of thing for
#. the general case
#. This function is called whenever text is inserted into one of Gaim's
#. text objects.  If the object is an instant message or chat, speak
#. the text
#. If we're not watching anything, do the default behavior
#. this function is called when any object in Gaim gets the focus
#. The text boxes in chat and IM windows have no names - so we give
#. them some here
