    more than one string in another locale.  We provide a convention to
    provide contextual information for the string so that translators can
    do the right thing: we embed a '|' character in the string to be
    translated.  The string before the '|' provides the context, and the
    string after the '|' provides the string to translate.  For example:
    'radiobutton|selected' and 'text|selected' are used to provide context
    for the word 'selected'.

    We need to handle the case where the string has not been translated,
    however, and we do so by stripping off the contextual information."""
