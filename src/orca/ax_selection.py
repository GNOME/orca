"""
Utilities for obtaining information about containers supporting selection.
These utilities are app-type- and toolkit-agnostic. Utilities that might have
different implementations or results depending on the type of app (e.g. terminal,
chat, web) or toolkit (e.g. Qt, Gtk) should be in script_utilities.py file(s).

N.B. There are currently utilities that should never have custom implementations
that live in script_utilities.py files. These will be moved over time.
