# Translators: This string appears on a button in a dialog. "Activating" the

# object were clicked on with the mouse. If the object is a link, activating

# Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
# within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
# command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
# "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
# "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
# move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
# it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
# the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
# handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
# is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
# is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
# navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
# pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
# focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
# If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

# Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior

# Orca doesn't know what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca
# treats key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
# key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget. Orca
# optionally can attempt to detect which mode is appropriate for the current
# situation and switch automatically. This string is a label for a GUI option to
# enable such automatic switching when caret navigation commands are used. As an
# example, if this setting were enabled, pressing Down Arrow would allow you to
# move into an entry but once you had done so, Orca would switch to Focus mode
# and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser
# and not by Orca. If this setting is not enabled, Orca would continue to control
# what happens when you press an arrow key, thus making it possible to arrow out
