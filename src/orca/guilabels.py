# Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
# within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
# command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
# "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
# "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
# move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
# it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
# the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
# handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
# is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
# is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
# navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
# pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
# focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
# If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

# presenting a capital letter (which Speech Dispatcher refers to as 'spell'),
# or play a tone (which Speech Dispatcher refers to as a sound 'icon'). Orca
# refers to these things as 'capitalization style'. This string is the text of

# fact that text is written in capital letters or is a link; or that text is
# actually visible on the screen as opposed to an Orca-specific message. The
# available voice types in Orca include: default, uppercase, hyperlink, and
# system -- each of which can be configured by the user to sound the way he/she
# finds most helpful. This string is displayed in the label for the combo box

# which is not displayed on the screen as text, but is still being communicated
# by the system in some visual fashion. For instance, Orca says "misspelled" to

# third item is selected. And so on.
