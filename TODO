- Search all modules for "TODO" - there's a lot.  All "TODO" comments
  that have a "HACK" in them usually indicate some odd workaround for
  an apparent AT-SPI implementation oddity.
- Make the kbd module maintain a stack of keypresses, rather than only
  the last individual keypress
- Fix the autogen stuff to better detect package dependencies
- Fix the autogen stuff to better install Orca in the python site-packages
  area if python isn't installed under --prefix.
- Need to handle AT-SPI failures with respect to CORBA (e.g., COMM_FAILURE).
  * Perhaps have a well known "onCommFailure" method in the orca module
    that is called on failures.  This would do the appropriate recovery.
- Implement the style guide for speech and braille.
- Sometimes on Fedora Core 4, when a terminal is started after orca is
  running, the terminal comes up with the "unknown" role.
- Sometimes on Fedora Core 4, the left hand panel (e.g., the list of
  configuration groups) in kickstart will come up with the "unknown" role.
- Cannot register a callback with FreeTTS driver on Fedora (COMM_FAILURE);
  DECtalk apparently suffers from the same problem.
- GEdit will often hang when you quit it while running Orca
  > UPDATE: This is the result of an AT-SPI bug that is awaiting a patch.
    The bug happens when any AT tickles the parental hierarchy of objects
    that it receives via events.  This appears to be due to an object
    reuse scheme in libspi.  The crux of the problem seems to be that
    libspi gives us different object types depending upon whether we
    get an Accessible from an event for by getting it via the "embedded
    hierarchy" (i.e., looking at children).  This seems to result in
    a bad state and possibly even memory corruption in the client.
- gnome-terminal: "Edit" -> "Current Profile..." -> "Colors"; press the
  color palette button.  The color editing widget is a monster.
- Orca seg faults when it exits.
  > UPDATE: WDW - after some investigation, this seems to be happening
    when attempting to return from a glib call.  Originally thought
    this might be due to shutting down bonobo (bonobo.main_quit) when
    handling a keyboard event.  After prototyping something to shut down
    on a GLib idle handler, however, this didn't seem to be the case.
- When nothing has focus the old stuff on the braille display should go away.
  It should speak and braille "no focus."
- When in a text editor such as GEdit doing a find orca should speak
  the new line landed on.
