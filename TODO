- Search all modules for "TODO" - there's a lot.  All "TODO" comments
  that have a "HACK" in them usually indicate some odd workaround for
  an apparent AT-SPI implementation oddity.

- Make the kbd module maintain a stack of keypresses, rather than only
  the last individual keypress

- Fix the autogen stuff to better detect package dependencies

- Fix the autogen stuff to better install Orca in the python site-packages
  area if python isn't installed under --prefix.

- Implement the style guide for speech and braille.

- Sometimes on Fedora Core 4, when a terminal is started after orca is
  running, the terminal comes up with the "unknown" role.

- Sometimes on Fedora Core 4, the left hand panel (e.g., the list of
  configuration groups) in kickstart will come up with the "unknown" role.

- Cannot register a callback with FreeTTS driver on Fedora (COMM_FAILURE);
  DECtalk apparently suffers from the same problem.  
  > UPDATE: This appears to be something that is a well known problem,
    requiring someone to make a ~/.orbitrc file containing the line:
    ORBIIOPIPv4=1

- GEdit will often hang when you quit it while running Orca
  > UPDATE: This is the result of an AT-SPI bug that is awaiting a patch.
    The bug happens when any AT tickles the parental hierarchy of objects
    that it receives via events.  This appears to be due to an object
    reuse scheme in libspi.  The crux of the problem seems to be that
    libspi gives us different object types depending upon whether we
    get an Accessible from an event for by getting it via the "embedded
    hierarchy" (i.e., looking at children).  This seems to result in
    a bad state and possibly even memory corruption in the client.
  > UPDATE: BillH has given us a patch that seems to do the trick here.

- gnome-terminal: "Edit" -> "Current Profile..." -> "Colors"; press the
  color palette button.  The color editing widget is a monster.

- Orca seg faults when it exits.
  > UPDATE: WDW - after some investigation, this seems to be happening
    when attempting to return from a glib call.  Originally thought
    this might be due to shutting down bonobo (bonobo.main_quit) when
    handling a keyboard event.  After prototyping something to shut down
    on a GLib idle handler, however, this didn't seem to be the case.

- When nothing has focus the old stuff on the braille display should go away.
  It should speak and braille "no focus."

- When in a text editor such as GEdit doing a find orca should speak
  the new line landed on.

- speech.say("uppercase", text) only seems to work once in a sequence
  of letters

- flat review mode currently places the cursor at the last cell of
  the display when moving word by word across long lines.  It should
  attempt to show the entire word.

- flat review mode currently does very little to left align multiline
  text areas.  It should attempt to consistently place the first character
  of each line in the same logical cell location.

- Create a tool to analyze scripts to extract keybindings and their
  "learn mode" documentation as a means to automatically document the
  input methods for Orca.

- Exiting learn mode should display current locus of focus.

- The volume control in the panel presents a challenge.  It's components
  should appear in review mode.  In addition, other embedded components
  in the top panel should not say "blank" in review mode.

- Tabs should be presented better in both focus tracking and flat review.
  Right now, they are just output as a "I".  They should be expanded out
  to spaces on the braille display.

- Check box table cells probably should say "check box" and their state
  (both braille and speech) in flat review mode.

- The dectalk-synthesis-driver frequently hangs - we need to find out why
  and either have it exit or restart.

- FreeTTS's "stop" performance is horrible on Solaris 11.
  >UPDATE: This is a problem with the gnome-speech driver for FreeTTS;
   it wasn't respecting the "streaming" option and was thus stuck using
   the clip audio player.  This has been fixed for post gnome-speech-0.3.8.

- Empty tree tables should announce themselves as empty.

- Flat review does not find table column headers in the network configuration
  utility.

- Default.py should probably be divided:  place all common stuff like 
  locusOfFocus and flat review stuff in default.  Put all event handling
  in gtk.py, soffice.py, etc.

- HANG: "Places->Search For Files..."
        (brings up Search for Files app)
        Look in folder: Filesystem
        Search for a file (e.g., "java*.xml")
        Tab to "Search Results"
	Orca will hang.
	
- The key event handler should:
  > Use global handlers for synchronous keyboard events - this will
    (or should) work around the fact that keycodes emitted by Java
    applications are different from the rest of the world.  Note
    that this requires the Xserver XEvIE extension to be in place.
  > Use synchronous listeners sparingly.  For all other things, such
    as "any keystroke stops speech," one should consider asynchronous
    listeners.  NOTE: for learn mode, one must have synchronous listeners
    for all keystrokes.
