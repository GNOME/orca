	* src/orca/a11y.py: add an attempt at getting the group
	* src/orca/rolenames.py: sync up with ATK rolenames
	* src/orca/speech.py: capture CORBA failures for now
	* src/orca/default.py: passes at defaultPresenter,
	pushButtonPresenter, toggleButtonPresenter, radioButtonPresenter,
	menuBarPresenter, menuPresenter, and sliderPresenter.
	* docs/programmers-guide/programmers-guide.{sgml,pdf}: some 
	level of introduction to style.  Still much work to do when it
	comes to notions of levels of verbosity and speaker style.

	* src/orca/{a11y.py, debug.py, default.py, kbd.py, metacity,py,
	orca.py, rolenames.py, speech.py}: finer grained control over
	debugging.  Debugging is now set by a numerical value rather than
	a boolean.  See debug.py for the different levels.  To turn
	debugging on, set "debugLevel = 500" (or some appropriate number)
	in settings.py.  For backwards compatibility, "debug = True" in
	this file will default to debug.LEVEL_FINER.

2005-04-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am: add debug.py to orca_python_PYTHON

2005-04-01  Steve Murphy  <murf@e-tools.com>

        * configure.in: Added "rw" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-04-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* default-keybindings.ppy, default.py, speech.py: add sayAgain
	support to repeat last utterance spoken
	* default.py: more work to be in line with gnopernicus
	* rolenames.py: import text for speech and Braille from gnopernicus
	* speech.py: interrupt speech when given something new to say
	* mag.py: a little better (but far from perfect) way to move ROI
	to match object with focus; also add support for tracking mouse events
	
2005-03-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* gnome-terminal.py:  call default.brlUpdateText
	* a11y.py: add capability to get component extents from 
	an accessible
	* orca.py, default.py: add beginnings of magnification support
	* mag.py: early magnification support
	
2005-03-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Upgrade to brltty-3.6.1 (TODO: perhaps add backwards
	compatibility in if people complain.).
	* Add *.pyc (compiled *.py files) to src/orca/.cvsignore.
	* Use try/except blocks more sparingly to allow for easier
	debugging.  Also add more debugging features to debug.py.
	A quite note on debugging: add "debug = True" to 
	~/.orca/settings.py to turn debugging on.
	* Fix presentation of radio and checkbox menu items.
	* Make menus speak like Gnopernicus for now.
	* Backout a11y.py workaround for Nautilus shortcomings; it turns
	out this workaround was hurting the overall logic.
	
2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Remove src/orca/dispatcher.py as it was obsoleted by the
	  dispathcher table in a11y.py.

	* Nearly every source file: added much documentation and many
	  TODO comments.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py (init): remove call to core.init() as this
	is done in a11y.init().  The dual call was causing orca to crash.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speech.py (init): add extra parameters to call to
	bonobo.activation.activate_from_id as a result of change to
	gnome-python on 2004-12-13.

2005-02-03  Alessio Frusciante  <algol@firenze.linux.it>

	* configure.in: Added "it" (Italian) to ALL_LINGUAS.

	the registry can't be activated (i.E. the Orca core can't be
	initialized)

	* src/core/coremodule.c (core_module_init): Fix return values on
	exception.

2004-08-21  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@cvs.gnome.org>

	CORBA_COMM_FAILURE if the object has died.

2004-07-02  Hendrik Brandt  <hebra@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "de" (German) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-30    <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__get_relations): New
	implementation which makes sure relations are narrowed to make
	sure things work right with Java.
	(Accessible.__get_app): Get app also fails if the thing it finds
	is not an application.
	(onWindowActivated): Make sure focussedAp is narrowed so it works
	right with Java.
	(onFocus): Since we're tracking the active application, objects
	which get focus get their app attribute set to the active
	application-- this hack is needed for Nautilus.
	(getLabel): Ensure the target that we get from a relation is an
	accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/Gecko.py (presentNextHypertext): Fixed to use new
	accessible wrapper.
	(onFocus): Fixed to use new accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/orca.in: Don't speak "selcome to Orca" here-- now
	spoken in orca.py in start.

	* src/orca/default.py: UPdated to use new accesible wrappers.

	* src/orca/a11y.py: Added an accessible wrapper in pythohn. MOved
	all the listeners which update the object caches to a11y.py.

	pyaccessible as the source -- it includes a pycorba_object.

	than a pyaccessible.

	* src/core/coremodule.c: Removed pyaccessible stuff including all
	the event handlers which refresh the cache.
