General:

* Removed some references to the string "CVS" in docs.  Many apologies

  a long time ago.

  KP_2) 3X.

  sibling of status bar when presenting status bar contents

* Detection code for bgo#607847.  This attempts to find problems with
  Orca keybindings conflicting or not working with the X Server
  keymap.  You need to enable settings.validateKeyBindings in order
  for this to kick in.

2.27.90 - 09-Aug-2009

General:

* Fix for bgo#480883 - User can pan right in braille indefinitely at
  the end of a web page

* Fix for bgo#523693 - Positioning of the cursor when editing text

  This fixes a 'jumping cursor' problem when deleting text in the
  middle of a long text area and also adds a _realignViewport method
  to braille.py.  The method works off new settings (you need to
  hand-edit your ~/.orca/user-settings.py or ~/.orca/orca-customizations.py
  file for now):

    ALIGN_BRAILLE_BY_EDGE   = 0
    ALIGN_BRAILLE_BY_MARGIN = 1
    ALIGN_BRAILLE_BY_WORD   = 2
    brailleAlignmentMargin  = 3
    brailleMaximumJump      = 8
    brailleAlignmentStyle   = ALIGN_BRAILLE_BY_EDGE

  The default alignment style matches what we have today.

  The ALIGN_BRAILLE_BY_MARGIN style uses brailleAlignmentMargin and is
  effectively a "push" model - when you get to the edge of the
  display, the viewport is pushed to keep the cursor cell at the
  margin (until you reach the edge of the text).

  The ALIGN_BRAILLE_BY_WORD style uses brailleAlignmentMargin in the
  same push model above, but when it pushes the viewport, it pushes it
  so the edge lands on a word boundary.  In the event we hit a really
  long word, the brailleMaximumJump setting limits how far we jump.

* Fix for bgo#570070 - Remove 'item' from spoken string that
  represents position/index information

* Fix for bgo#574344 - Support for different progress bar "verbosity
  levels" should be implemented

* Fix for bgo#576847 - Add ability to 'flash' braille messages

  This adds a 'flashTime' parameter to the braille.displayMessage and
  braille.displayRegions methods.  If it is 0, the message will not be
  flashed.  If it is greater than 0, the current message on the display
  will be saved and the new message will be flashed for flashTime
  milliseconds.  If it is less than 0, the current message on the display
  will be saved and the new message will be shown until some other action,
  such as a keypress or cursor routing key press, causes the display to
  revert back to the original message.

* Fix for bgo#578832 - Flash locking modifier key state in braille

  This flashes a message for the Caps Lock modifier if the "Enable
  locking keys" checkbox is checked on the "Key Echo" tab in the Orca
  preferences UI. The flash time is settable via the
  'brailleFlashTime' setting which represents the number of
  milliseconds to flash a message.

* Fix for bgo#582318 - Pressing panning buttons on the braille display
  should not interrupt speech

* Fix for bgo#582491 - Strange message table behavior with Evolution

* Fix for bgo#589610 - isupper should be used on unicode and not UTF-8
  strings

* Fix for bgo#590219 - Incorrect text displayed with Orca quit
  confirmation dialog when the user using non english locale

* Fix for bgo#590378 - configure.in and orca.spec.in need updating for
  compile and runtime dependencies.

* Fix for bgo#590382 - Orca should have a script for packagemanager

OpenOffice/StarOffice:

* Fix for bgo#363820 - Orca should inform the user when text in given

2.27.5 - 27-Jul-2009

General:

* Migrated to GtkBuilder (bgo#582506 and bgo#589362)

* Fix for bgo#434600 – cursor routing keys cannot be used to position
  caret at end of line

* Re-fix for bgo#568696 - locus of focus changes when updating list of
  files in nautilus

* Work on bgo#575784 - accented characters are not echoed correctly.
  Orca now has two new checkboxes on the "Key Echo" tab of the
  preferences UI.  The first, "Enable non-spacing diacritical keys",
  specifies whether dead keys are echoed or not.  The second, "Enable
  echo by character", specifies if the exact character typed in an
  editable text area is to be spoken.  This differs from the "Enable
  alphanumeric and punctuation keys" setting in that it echos the
  characters that are typed vs. the keys that were pressed.  If both
  are enabled, preference is given to character echo where it applies.

* Fix for bgo#578106 - Gtk Warning on starting Orca Preferences GUI

* Fix for bgo#585049 - When I select paragraphs with Ctrl+Shift+Down
  key combination, Orca says incorrect information message

* Fix for bgo#585417 - Allow pauses to be inserted in speech output

* Fix for bgo#585948 - Automatic position index spoken request.  Orca
  now has a "Speak child position" on the "Speech" tab in the
  preferences UI.  When selected, Orca will speak the child position
  (e.g., 'item 6 of 7') of various objects.

* Fix for bgo#588471 - Orca's clicking functionality should click on
  the locusOfFocus when not in flat review

* Fix for bgo#588774 - Tooltips aren't always presented

* Fix for bgo#589244 - Remove libgail-gnome usage, use gail in gtk+
  instead

* Fix for bgo#589497 - orca shouldn't speak entering / leaving flat
  review mode when verbosity is set to brief

* Fix for bgo#589504 - Orca double speaks typed characters when input
  method is enabled

Firefox:

* Fix for bgo#480883 - Braille navigation on Webpages. The pan left
  and pan right buttons on the braille display should now allow you to
  scroll through the page content in linear order.

* Fix for bgo#586399 - Orca should provide support/access to "Mouse
  Overs" in web content.  See the following message for a complete
  description:
  http://mail.gnome.org/archives/orca-list/2009-July/msg00186.html.

* Fix for bgo#588910 - Orca should support the spellcheck as you go in
  mozilla applications

* Fix for bgo#589455 - Can not activate links with structural
  navigation keys

2.27.4 - 13-Jul-2009

General:

* Fix for doo#9676 - Orca fails to launch.  Make sure setting the PATH
  follows sh syntax and not bash.

* Latent work for bgo#400729 - Orca should provide support for general
  audio.  This adds some latent support for audio that gives people
  something to experiment with as soon as bgo#570658 is done.

* Fix for bgo#561452 - Factor out included "louis" C extension.  This
  now requires liblouis 1.6.2 and the liblouis 1.6.2 "louis" python
  module in order for contracted braille to work with Orca.  See
  http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Braille for more information.

* Fix for bgo#568696 - locus of focus changes when updating list of
  files in nautilus.

* Much more work on bgo#570658 - Refactor the speech and braille
  generators. This refactor is almost complete. After a pass to
  simplify and consolidate the formatting strings, we should be ready
  to document how you can customize Orca presentation for yourself.

* More work on bgo#575614 - Please add speakable characters: → and ←.

* Fix for bgo#583199 - orca should not hang itself, or the desktop
  when brltty is killed. This fix allows BrlTTY to be killed,
  restarted, started before Orca, started after Orca, etc.  This
  requires a fix in BrlTTY that will appear in a to-be-released
  version of BrlTTY (i.e., the fix is not in BrlTTY 4.0).  Note that
  this change has caused us to change the default value of
  settings.enableBraille to False to prevent speech-only users from
  incurring unnecessary overhead.

* Fix for bgo#584796 - Invoking the application specific preferences
  for Orca when in the Orca Quit dialog freezes speech.

* Fix for bgo#585103 - Inconsistent behavior of flat review.

* Provisional work on bgo#585417 - Allow pauses to be inserted in
  speech output.  This provides code that will modify the speech
  formatting strings if orca.settings.useExperimentalSpeechProsody is
  True (the default value is True for this release).  This allows
  users to experiment with the prosody work Hammer Attila has done
  before we finally commit to it.

  NOTE: to indicate things are still experimental, informational
  messages will be included on the command line where you run Orca.
  These informational messages say that pauses have been added to the
  formatting strings.  When the integration is done, these messages
  will be removed.

* Fix for bgo#585897 - Pronunciation substitution can miss words due
  to word delimiters

* Fix for bgo#586385 - When I using where am I function with
  Openoffice.org Calc, the spoken row and column information are not
  marked for translation.

* Fix for bgo#586580 - Orca repeats the coordinates of Calc cells.

* Fix for bgo#588403 - Implement ability to route the mouse pointer
  without clicking. This implements support for routing the pointer to
  the current location (either the area under flat review or the
  locusOfFocus).

* Fix for crash (no bug number) - Prevent stack trace when contracted
  braille is being used. The trace would also kill speech.

OpenOffice/StarOffice:

* Fix for bug #583811 - Doing a select all in OOo Writer causes Orca
  to say "selected" for each paragraph.

Thunderbird:

* Fix for bgo#584263 - When I compose or reply to a message with
  Thunderbird, the Ctrl+End key combination does not work.

* Fix for bgo#584837 - Find dialog fails to move caret to desired
  location in Thunderbird.

* Fix for bgo#568658 - Sometimes Orca announces the wrong subject in
  Thunderbird.

Firefox:

* Fix for bgo#584540 - Orca should not duplicate images and lines of
  text on facebook

* Fix for bgo#585871 - WhereAmI info in FF doesn't include link
  text.

* Fix for bgo#587794 - In some pages I cannot read using the Down
  Arrow key.

* Fix for bgo#588344 - Missed text on a page in Firefox.

2.27.3 - 15-Jun-2009

General:

* We no longer manually update the ChangeLog each time we commit a
  change.  Instead, the ChangeLog will be automatically generated from
  the git logs when we create a new release.  If you pull from git,
  you can use 'git log' for a detailed list of changes.

* Much work on bgo#570658 - Refactor the speech and braille
  generators.  This represents a HUGE REFACTOR for Orca.  The speech
  generators have been completely rewritten to use formatting strings,
  and they are now used by the focus tracking and where am I code.
  This has simplified the code base a lot, increased performance in
  some areas, and has fixed a number of latent bugs.  It also enables
  finer granularity for switching voices and helps set us up for
  incorporating audio cues.  Please help us by testing with the latest
  code and by reporting issues and suggestions at orca-list@gnome.org.

* Fix for bgo#583274 - portability for orca script (Thomas Klausner)

* Fix for bgo#585017 - Orca should speak the toggled state of flat
  review mode

* Fix for bgo#585792 - i18n strings should use parameterized forms

OpenOffice:

* Significant progress on bgo#574720 - Table Navigation Keys for
  OpenOffice Writer. Structural navigation can be enabled/disabled in
  OOo with Orca+Z. It is disabled by default in OOo because, unlike in
  Gecko, odds are that you'll want to type. :-) Mind you right now we
  don't have structural navigation by headings, etc. in Writer. But
  one day we will. Alt + the arrows move by cell, Alt + Home/End move
  to the beginning/ending of the table respectively.

* Fix for bug #583414 - Orca should announce when is at last cell on
  a table in OOo.

2.27.2 - 25-May-2009

General:

* Work on bug #354471 - Text selection from braille input device.
  This is the first step of implementing this feature.  Here's the
  behavior:

  KEY_CMD_CUTBEGIN (Dot 1 + cursor routing key on my display) -
  this will specify the start of a selection.  Orca will merely
  move the caret to the given spot and will clear any existing
  selection.

  KEY_CMD_CUTLINE (Dot 4 + cursor routing key on my display) -
  this will specify the end of a selection and the selected text
  is automatically copied to the system clipboard.  If a selection
  doesn't exist, Orca creates a new one where the other endpoint
  of the selection is where the caret is.  If a selection exists
  and the selection point is outside the existing selection, Orca
  extends the existing one.  If a selection exists and the
  selection point is inside the existing selection, Orca trims the
  selection from the right (i.e., the selected text that's after
  the selection point becomes unselected).

  Known issues that need to be resolved:

  1) This only works in text areas.  It doesn't work across things
     such as paragraphs in OpenOffice.

  2) There's some strangeness with speech feedback: it sometimes
     says "unselected" when the text is selected.  This should be
     fixable, but there also probably shouldn't be any speech
     feedback when doing this from the braille display.

* Fix for bug #466841 - Orca doesn't announce items when Alt+Tabbing
  if Compiz is enabled. This fix is designed to improve Orca's access
  to the basic window switcher in Compiz. There are still bugs in
  Compiz which make providing compelling access difficult, but this
  should at least make switching windows accessible.

* Fix for bug #511468 - Ekiga chat window accessibility problem.

* Fix for bug #574221 - left-pane in Ekiga's preference box can't be
  read at start-up.

* Fix for bug #575614 - Please add speakable characters: → and ←.

* Fix for bug #577977 - provide speech feedback for "repeat last find"
  in Gedit.

* Fix for bug #581372 - Move cursor routing and six dot key handling
  from braille.py to script.  With the cleanup from bug #581532 to
  remove the custom brl module and move directly to the brlapi module
  provided by BrlTTY/BrlAPI, we are now able to handle BrlAPI commands
  much better.  This patch 'uncovers' the handling the cursor routing
  keys and the six dot keys; they are no longer swallowed/handled by
  the braille.py module alone.  Instead, they go to the script like
  any other event.  By default, the script just turns around and calls
  braille.py methods, but it can also feel free to override them.  For
  example, it might look at keyboard modifiers along with a cursor
  routing key to see if it wants to select text or not.

  As a note, the BrlAPI events come to us as a dictionary containing a
  bunch of information about the event.  For example, the cursor
  routing command contains information about which routing key was
  pressed.  The six dots command, which is used to turn contracted
  braille on or off, contains information about whether the user wants
  to turn contracted braille on (dots 2-3-5 on my Baum display) or off
  (dots 2-3-6 on my Baum display).  Right now, expressing interest in
  braille events is still done by the command (e.g.,
  brlapi.KEY_CMD_HOME, brlapi.KEY_CMD_ROUTE, brlapi.KEY_CMD_SIXDOTS)
  and it is up to the event handler to determine how to handle the
  arguments.

* Fix for bug #581532 - Remove brl module.  Orca now uses the BrlAPI
  python bindings.

* Fix for bug #582028 - Character pronunciations are not used when
  navigating by line. This provides a fallback to the chnames
  dictionary.

* Fix for bug #582684 - Arrowing left/right across tree tables causes
  whole row to be spoken.

OpenOffice:

* Work on bug #574720 - Table Navigation Keys for OpenOffice Writer.
  This adds in support for Alt + the cursoring keys for navigation in
  OOo tables. Note that you will need to first enable structural by
  pressing Orca + Z. We plan to add in the customizations/settings
  available in the Gecko preferences, as well as for the announcement
  of dynamic row and column headers when navigating.

Firefox:

* Fix for bug #530784 - whereAmI info for list items in web content
  needs to be improved.

* Fix for bug #577900 - Blank lines in Firefox text areas incorrectly
  spoken.

2.27.1 - 04-May-2009

General:

* Much work to handle the transition from subversion to git.
  (Willie Walker, Olav Vitters, Mesar Hameed)

* Updated script writer's guide -- the document lives in
  docs/doc-set/internals.html. (Willie Walker)

* Add setting to disable the pyatspi GIL idle handler:
  useGILIdleHandler.  This change is made in response to
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=576954 where it appears as
  though the GIL idle handler in pyatspi is causing consumers of
  pyatspi (e.g., Orca and accerciser) to start consuming 100% of a CPU
  when the machine is idle.  We're pretty sure the GIL handler is not
  necessary, so this change gets rid of it for the 2.27.1 development
  build of Orca.  If we see that users notice strange lock ups,
  however, we may need to change things back. (Willie Walker)

* Adjust debug utilities to print to console and debug log.
  (Willie Walker)

* Fix for bug #579052 - Orca should be able to run with AT-SPI/D-Bus.
  (Willie Walker)

* Fix for bug #573535 - Orca should use the 16x16 pixels application
  icon for Main and Preferences windows. (Stephen Brandt)

* Fix for bug #575921 - When I working with the gcalctool application,
  Orca says too lot of the result of the mathematic operations.
  (Willie Walker)

* Fix for bug #576037 - Bind F1 key to help page. (Willie Walker)

* Fix for bug #576438 - Provide state change information for radio
  buttons that require you to press space to select them.
  (Willie Walker)

* Fix for bug #577239 - Cannot navigate by line through multi-line HTML
  list items in Firefox/Thunderbird when arrowToLineBeginning is
  False. (Joanmarie Diggs)

* Fix for bug #577330 - Detect whether speech dispatcher is installed
  or not. (Tomas Cerha)

* Fix for bug #577977 - provide speech feedback for "repeat last find"
  in Gedit. (Nolan Darilek)

* Fix for bug #577979 - Pressing Down Arrow from the middle of a
  multi-line HTML list item initially moves to the beginning of the
  line when arrowToLineBeginning is False.  (Joanmarie Diggs)

* Fix for bug #580423 - Remove deprecated libgnomeui dependency. Use
  DBus org.gnome.SessionManager.Logout instead of
  gnome.ui.master_client().request_save. (Willie Walker)

* Fix for bug #580329 - Use show_uri() to display help window.
  (Vincent Legoll)

OpenOffice:

* Fix for bug #577245 - Present paragraph-style information in
  OpenOffice. (Willie Walker)

* Fix for bug #578072 - Orca does not always present text attributes
  in braille in OOo documents. (Joanmarie Diggs)

  espeechfactory.py and other changes. Thanks Dmitri Paduchikh!

  if you're currently autostarting Orca.

* Partial fix for bug #554002 - Orca App-Preferences dialog page tabs
  are "off" by one in speech and braille. (This fixes them for focus
  tracking. It turns out they are "off" in flat review as well.)

* Fix for bug #554111 - Orca doesn't speak the Rhythmbox rating
  widget. Please note: At the moment, this functionality requires
  getting the latest patch by Jonathan Matthew on bug #368641 and
  building Rhythmbox from svn trunk. Many thanks Jonathan!!

  contextual braille Information.  Thanks Halim Sahin!

* Fix for bug #553877 - Need to implement FF find functionality for
  Yelp.

* More work on bug #535178 - In Gecko, we should get the needed text
  for the speech and braille contexts while building up the line.

* Fix for bug #527022 - updateBraille() has significant whitespace
  issues, should use braille generators when possible, and fails to
  underline links.

* Fix for bug #552887 - Orca gets stuck in graphical boxes on websites.

* Started work on bug #554831 - Google calendar unusable with
  orca. Please note that Google calendar is still unusable with
  Orca. This part of the fix just prevents a hang.

* Workaround for bug #555466 - Orca should attempt to correct
  the Firefox breakage introduced by bug 535827 via script mapping.

2.23.92 - 08-Sep-2008

General:

* Partial fix for bug #527022 - Linked text should be "underlined" in

  release of GNOME.

* Fix for bug #550249 - configure doesn't use find bonobo python


Yelp:

* Much work toward the fix for bug #356041 - GNOME Help (yelp) is
  inaccessible. Please note that access to Yelp is a work in
  progress: on our end, and on the Yelp end, and may also require
  the Mozilla guys to fix something on their end. As of today, in
  order for the yelp script to work, you will need to build yelp --
  after applying the patch attached to bug #545162. Many, many,
  many thanks to Ginn Chen for that patch and for getting to the
  bottom of a rather odd accessibility hierarchy.

StarOffice/OpenOffice:

* Fix for bug #515923 - 'Area' labels of Calc Headers/Footers dialog
  not always announced.

* Fix for for bug #550137 - Presentation of table content in OOo
  Writer is largely hosed and we're double-speaking paragraphs in OOo
  Writer docs.

* Fix for bug #551077 - Traceback and loss of speech in OOo
  Writer docs with both links and multbyte characters on the
  same line

* Fix for bug #551159 - Orca says "link" when it shouldn't and
  sometimes fails to say it when it should in OOo Writer documents.

Firefox:

* Fix for bug #541605 - updateBraille() can take an unreasonable
  amount of time with certain pages in Firefox 3.

* Fix for bug #550873 - Some live region text updates are not
  presented

* Fix for bug #535183 - Word navigation is inconsistent in Thunderbird
  and Firefox.

* Work on bug #542833 - Flat review in Thunderbird is largely broken.
 This part of the fix should stop us from hanging if flat review is

 screen. There is still more work that needs to be done on this bug.

  with Orca

  This requires a new gnome-mag release as well.

  configurable per application.

* Fix for bug #505293 - Zoomer borders should only be displayed at
  source display intersection

* Fix for bug #505306 - Orca's color filtering combo box should be
  greyed out if the filters are not available

* Fix for bug #508679 - The second time to enable the Braille Monitor,
  it can not be lauched

* Fix for bug #508777 - HTTP-based Recording ability should not be
  enabled by default

Evolution:

* Fix for bug #490317 - Orca echoes the first letter of each new line
  when composing a message in Evolution

Java platform:

* Fix for bug #507886 - Orca+Space when in Java application presents
  script summary debug

Firefox/Thunderbird:

* Work on bug #414762 - Control Home/End, Up/Down Arrow don't always
  work in Firefox.  Firefox still has some navigation issues which
  prevent things like Control Home and Control End from doing what we
  would want/expect.  Therefore, we've taken over these keystrokes by
  default. :-) They should always move you to the top and bottom of
  the document now if Orca is controlling the caret.  If you would
  prefer to have Control Home and Control End exhibit the default FF
  behavior, toggle to a Gecko-controlled caret or change the
  keybindings in the Orca Preferences dialog for Minefield.

* Fix for bug #480881 - Firefox is very slow on pages with forms

* Fix for bug #500016 - Reading web pages by line in Firefox 3 is
  slow

* Fix for bug #502084 - Running Orca with Thunderbird v2.0.X with
  compose window open generates a stack trace

* Fix for bug #504742 - Gecko.py should not call
  getLineContentsAtOffset() twice unnecessarily

* Fix for bug #504785 - Orca repeats certain lines twice in Firefox 3

* Fix for bug #505102 - Pressing Up/Down in FF3 is moving to spaces at
  the end of the current line

* Fix for bug #506360 - find{Next,Previous}Line() should be more
  efficient.  Note that this is one of the new "performance
  enhancements" that has been well-tested, but may contain side
  effects.  Please give us your feedback.  If you're unsure as to
  whether this change is responsible for a problem you are seeing, you
  can place the following two lines in your
  ~/.orca/orca-customizations.py file:

  import orca.Gecko
  orca.Gecko.useNewLineNav = False

  If True (the default), the new enhancements are used; if False, they
  are not.  If this change is responsible, let us know.

* Fix for bug #508624 - Checkbox tristate not announcing state changes

* Work on bug #508784 - Orca needs to handle FF hierarchies that don't
  match reality.  Part of the solution is making sure the user can
  navigate to the areas.  That is what has been done.  We still need
  to present the elements and allow the user to navigate among them
  according to their spatial layout (e.g. reverse the list whose
  elements are ordered right-to-left).

* Fix for bug #509068 - We should prevent the user from arrowing into
  combo boxes in FF.  Now you can arrow "up to" a combo box, but
  should not be able to arrow into it accidentally.  If you arrow to a
  combo box and want to it give focus, you can do several things:
  Press Tab (as it's the next focusable item), press Orca+Tab (as it's
  the next form field, assuming your combo box is contained in a
  form), or press Alt+Down Arrow (which is the Firefox command to
  expand the current combo box).

2.21.4 - 17-Dec-2007

NOTE: There have been keybindings changes for this release.

* Instead of Orca+F1 to enter learn mode, the binding is now
  Orca+h.

* Instead of Orca+{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} to read the last nth message
  that was presented in an application such as gaim or gnome-mud, the
  binding is now Orca+{F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9}.

* The debugging keys have been rebound as well.  The new bindings
  are Orca+Ctrl+Alt+{the following}, where {the_following} is one
  of:

   End       - report active script info
   Home      - print list of known apps and their windows
   Page_Up   - print locus of focus ancestry
   Page_Down - print accessible hierarchy of active application

Magnification:

* Support "live updating" when setting various magnification features

  Changes made to the zoomer in the Orca Preferences now update in
  real time: it is no longer necessary to press the Apply button to
  see if the option you've chosen works for you and then undo it or
  adjust it if it doesn't.  Note that you must still press the Apply
  or the OK button to make your changes permanent.

* Bug #452316 - should have a "fullscreen" checkbox

  We've added a Position combo box so that it's easy to select the
  position of the zoomer.  The options are full screen, left half,
  right half, top half, bottom half, and custom.  Choosing custom
  allows you to specify the location of each edge of the zoomer.
  The new default zoomer position is full screen if full screen
  magnification is possible.  Otherwise, the right half of the
  screen will be used by default.

* Bug #463881 - Evaluate other gnome-mag features for inclusion in
  Orca prefs

  You can now adjust the brightness and contrast levels and use the
  colorblind filters from libcolorblind.  Basic brightness and
  contrast levels can be adjusted through the spin buttons on the
  Magnifier pane of the Orca Preferences dialog.  If you press the
  Advanced Settings button at the bottom of that pane, you'll be
  placed in a dialog box where you can customize the red, green, and
  blue brightness levels and contrast levels individually.  The
  Advanced Settings dialog is also where you can choose a color
  filter.  These options should enable you to create the color
  scheme that works best for you.  Note that in order for colorblind
  filtering to work, you must install libcolorblind and then
  re-build gnome-mag.

  You can also add a border to your zoomer to help separate it from
  the non-magnified area.  The border size and color are
  customizable.  We've also separated the cursor color from the
  cross-hair color so you no longer have to find the one color that
  works best for both.

* Bug #464705 - Provide option to keep caret in center of magnifier
  region of interest

  We've added individual tracking and alignment settings for
  controls and the text cursor: each can have an alignment of
  centered or push (move the magnifier window the least).  In
  addition, you can now specify an edge margin for the text cursor.
  This margin is how close the caret should be allowed to get to the
  edge of the screen before it's time to "push."  The margin can
  range from 0 to 50%, with 50% being the equivalent of choosing
  centering.  These options should make it easier to keep track of
  your location on the screen and ensure that you can always see the
  area around your point of focus.

* Bug #501414 - Orca should have (unbound) keybindings for quickly
  changing magnification settings

  We've added the following new commands:

  - Toggle color enhancements
  - Toggle mouse enhancements
  - Increase magnification level
  - Decrease magnification level
  - Cycle to the next magnifier position
  - Toggle magnifier on/off

   These should help you quickly change the zoomer to best access
   what you're working on.  These commands are "unbound," meaning
   they do not have a keystroke assigned to them.  You can define the
   keystrokes you would like to use on the Key Bindings pane of the
   Orca Preferences dialog: locate each command you wish to define a
   keystroke for, move to the Key Binding column, and press Return.
   You'll be prompted for the new key.  Press it (rather than type it
   out) and then press Return.  Note that these commands do not
   permanently change the settings; they merely alter them "on the
   fly."

* Bug #503965 - Orca should provide support for the pointer
  following focus and the zoomer

  If you're using the keyboard to perform a task and then move the
  mouse pointer, the zoomer would move away from your task and to
  the location of the mouse pointer.  We've added two options for
  dealing with this:

  - Pointer follows zoomer (enabled by default): If the mouse
    pointer is not on the screen when you initially move the mouse,
    it will be moved into the zoomer so that you can continue to see
    what you were working on.  If your preferred mouse tracking mode
    is centered, the pointer will be moved to the center; otherwise
    it will be moved to the item with focus.

 - Pointer follows focus (disabled by default): If this option is
   enabled, the mouse pointer will follow you as you arrow through
   menu items and move among controls in dialog boxes.

We also know we have more work to do and are tracking the work with
these bugs:

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=464734
Provide some kind of visual feedback for the item with focus

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504075
Orca should provide support for smooth/linear panning of the zoomer

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504077
Orca should support mouse bindings

Firefox:

* Fix for bug #451988 - Firefox: navigation by landmark

  The XHTML role attribute module defines the following roles: banner,
  contentinfo, definition, main, navigation, note, search, secondary,
  seealso.  New functionality in Orca allows you to navigate to the
  next and previous landmark on a page via the unbound keybindings:

  - Goes to previous landmark
  - Goes to next landmark

  These commands are "unbound," meaning they do not have a keystroke
  assigned to them.  You can define the keystrokes you would like to
  use on the Key Bindings pane of the Orca Preferences dialog: locate
  each command you wish to define a keystroke for, move to the Key
  Binding column, and press Return.  You'll be prompted for the new
  key.  Press it (rather than type it out) and then press Return.

* Fix for bug #466251 - Support ARIA live regions in Firefox/Gecko.
  http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/AJAX:WAI_ARIA_Live_Regions

  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) has recently received a great
  amount of attention, and the number of websites using or planning to
  use the technique is increasing. AJAX enables web developers to
  easily create sites that change areas of their content in response
  to user actions (such as in webmail applications) or real world
  changes (such as updates of stock prices).

  http://www.w3.org/TR/aria-state/ is designed to address these
  issues. Live region markup allows web page authors to specify when
  and how live changes to specific areas of a web page should be
  spoken or shown on a Braille display by a screen reader.

  The support for live regions in Orca is exposed via these
  keybindings:

  r and Shift+r: go to the next and previous live region relative to
  the current caret position

  y: go to the last (or current) live region that spoke

  \: cycle through the different levels of politeness

  Shift+\: turn monitoring of live regions on and off

  Orca+F1, Orca+F2, ..., Orca+F9: review the last nth live region
  announcement, where n is the number of the function key (i.e., the
  last announcement is obtained via Orca+F1, the 9th last announcement
  is obtained via Orca+F9).

* Fix for bug #473009 - Cannot arrow to the end of an HTML entry if
  Orca is controlling the caret

* Fix for bug #501447 - Orca sometimes fails to speak our location
  when entering FF3 entries

Performance and Quality:

* Much work on performance (bug #491756).  If you have specific areas
  that you think are slow, please let us know the exact details.  These
  performance fixes also rely upon fixes being made in other modules
  (pyorbit, pyatspi) for the GNOME 2.21.4 release.

* Completed major pylinting work (bug #486726).  This helped us
  greatly and found a few latent bugs.

General:

* Fix for bug #486970 - Where Am I should let you know you are in a
  toolbar

* Fix for bug #496846 - When tabbing to an editable combobox, text
  selection should be displayed in braille

* Fix for bug #503527 - Mnemonics are not supported well

2.21.3 - 03-Dec-2007

General:

* Lots and lots of pylint'ing (bug #486726)

* Beginning of work on performance (bug #491576).  We still have a bit
  of work to do.  We actually have some changes, but we're not comfortable
  with them yet.

* Fix for bug #407647 - Indicate the tree level, expanded state, and
  child nodes in the Pidgin buddy list

* Fix for bug #472665 - Speech Pane combo boxes mis-populating in Orca
  Preferences dialog

* Fix for bug #486899 - Where Am I doesn't present checkbox state in
  tables

* Fix for bug #486901 - When tabbing to a text area for a spinbox or
  editable combobox, text selection should be presented

* Fix for bug #486909 - Where Am I should say "n of m items selected"
  and "on item x of y" in layered pane

* Fix for bug #486971 - Where Am I doesn't present toggle button state

* Fix for bug #486976 - Basic Where Am I in multiline text areas
  should only present info for current line

* Fix for bug #487189 - Where Am I should present accessible
  description if it exists

* Fix for bug #500193 - Update keybindings for reviewing previous
  messages.  The keybindings have been moved from the number keys
  to the F1-F9 keys.  Bookmarks are still on the number keys.

  NOTE: this effects the Orca learn mode key.  Instead of Orca+F1,
  it is now Orca+h.

  NOTE: this effects the review of previous messages in gaim and
  gnome-mud.  Instead of Orca+{1,2,3,...} to read the last nth
  message, you now use Orca+{F1,F2,F3,...}.

  NOTE: this also effects the debugging tools.  The new bindings
  are Orca+Ctrl+Alt+{the following}, where {the_following} is one
  of:

  End - reportScriptInfoHandler
  Home - printActiveAppHandler
  Page_Up - printAncestryHandler (think "look upward in hierarchy")
  Page_Down - printHierarchyHandler (think "look down from the top")

Firefox:

* Fix for bug #462883 - ARIA tooltips/alerts are not being output

* Fix for bug #468551 - Support ARIA checkboxTriState

* Fix for bug #469718 - Gecko.inDocumentContent() needs to account for

  should not speak nodename again

* Fix for bug #487226 - "/" and the OrcaKey should not be hardcoded in
  default.py:whereAmI.  There are now two handlers instead of one,
  helping reduce a lot of confusion and complexity.  There is the
  "Performs the where am I operation" handler (same as we used to
  have) and the new "Speaks the title bar or status bar" handler.
  All keybindings are still the same.

* Fix for bug #487514 - Keys for navigation purposes should not be
  echoed

* Fix for bug #489875 - Some Orca macaroon oowriter and oocalc tests
  have timeout problems

  outputting all information for "object:selection-changed"
  menu bar event

* Additional work related to pyatspi migration (bug #489490,
  bug #491885).  We will be looking at improving performance for the
  next release.

General Orca:

* Typo fixes from Mario Lang (thanks Mario!)

* Updates to the specification

* Additions to the regression tests

* Fix for bug 368640 - Allow user to optionally ignore or be notified
  of tool tips

* Fix for bug 372273 - Add ability to configure app-specific settings
  via GUI. NOTE: Adjusted ORCA_MODIFIER+Control+Space to now bring
  up the application-specific preferences dialog. The previous usage
  (reload user settings) is now gone.

  echo settings and say "star" for the inserted characters

  ORCA_MODIFIER+Z will now toggle the structural navigation keys
  on/off.

* Fix for bug 422924 - Add more support for accessing HTML tables in

  Shift+T, Orca will indicate that this is a non-uniform table.
  When using structural navigation by cell, if the cell you navigate
  to has multiple headers that apply to it such as "week 2" and
  "Thursday", Orca will speak those headers if they are different from
  the headers from your previous location.  Orca also announces cell
  coordinates when navigating using structural navigation among cells.

  column.  Of course, depending on your preferences, that's a lot
  of verbiage.  Therefore, these are all customizable settings.

* Turn on Orca's caret navigation mode by default for Firefox.
  NOTE TO USERS: you can still toggle between Orca's caret navigation
  mode and Firefox's (i.e., Gecko) navigation mode by pressing
  Insert+F12.

* Much work on bug 400716 and 426360 (Firefox) to provide "say all"
  support by sentences.

* Fix for bug 430278 to improve the "where am I" functionality.  This
  also includes bug 427481 to fix the "where am I" feature of the
  Evolution Mail...Tasks toggle buttons.  This also is related to
  the fix for bug 423011 to finish the refactor of where_am_I module
  to have knowledge of the script it is working with.

* Fix for bug 426336 to refactor the find{Next,Previous}Role methods
  in Gecko.py for Firefox.  In addition, list navigation (L and
  Shift+L) is now restricted to ordered/unordered lists.  Before, form
  field lists were included because they, too, have a role of
  ROLE_LIST.

* Fix for bug 426684 to speak the entry text in Firefox when the caret
  is at the end of the line.

* Fix for bug 427722 to prevent web page navigation from getting stuck

  list items.

* Fix for bug 432674 to respect key echo settings and say "star" when

  NOTE TO USERS: the standard toolkit method for brining up a tooltip
  is Ctrl+F1 when the object has focus.

* Fix for bug 368626 to prevent gnome-panel from crashing when it
  pops up a tooltip.

* Fix for bug 423849 to reduce the chattiness of speech context.

* Fix for bug 427880 to restore metacity behavior of presenting the
  name of the window to get focus when you're doing an Alt+Tab.

  Orca preferences dialog.

* Fix for bug 425498 to provide option to allow user to quit Orca
  without needing to go through the "quit" confirmation dialog.

* Fix for bug 413109 to address HIG violations.  Thanks to Calum
  Benson for his work here.

* Fix bug 423738 to use gconf module methods instead of using exec.

* Work on bug 422487 to move the caret the first line of a message in
  in Evolution.  There are still issues with HTML messages, which may
  require changes in Evolution itself.  We're tracking this with the
  Evolution RFE: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423395.

* Workaround for Evolution bug 347964 to provide better user feedback
  when deleting messages in Evolution.

  characters and not as bytes when spelling an item.

* Fix for bug 410302 to provide support for the gnome-mud application.

  support.  NOTE: SPEECH DISPATCHER IS STILL UNSUPPORTED AT THIS TIME.
  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  (Thanks to community member Tomas Cerha for
  this contribution!!!).

* Fix for bug 419089 to refactor speech and braille generators in
  StarOffice.py script to use self._script.

* Work on bug 423011 to refactor the where_am_I module to know about
  the script that is using it.

* Fix for bug 319778 to remove hierarchical_presenter (we'll rely on

* Fix for bug 422924 to add table navigation in Firefox.  T and

  move you among table cells. Alt+Shift+{Home,End} will move you to
  the{top,bottom} of the current table.

  the next unvisited link; Shift U to the previous unvisited link; V
  to the next visited link; Shift V to the previous visited link.

* Fix for bug 416853 to prevent structural navigation keys from
  interfering with shortcuts. Ctrl+o and Ctrl+h now work as expected.

  to the next list; Shift L moves you to the previous list.

* Fix for bug 423537 to add list item structural navigtion.  I and

2.17.92 - 26-Feb-2007

* Much more work on Gecko.py support for Firefox.  Firefox support
  still has a ways to go, both inside Firefox itself and inside Orca.

* Fix for bug 412058 to terminate the python process better when it
  receives a TERM signal.  Note that one must send the TERM signal
  directly to the Python process.  Sending it to the shell script
  won't do since the shell script turns around and does a kill -9 on
  the Python process when it gets a TERM signal.  The motivation for
  this is to better support the code coverage analysis work that is
  being done by Lynn Monsanto.

* Work on bug 354479 to announce what we can about changes to the
  battery status.  There are currently issues with the AT-SPI
  support from the Galago support used by gnome-panel that prevent
  us from doing a more effect job here.

* Fix for bug 407480 to prevent "orca --help" and other informative
  commands from killing other Orca processes that might be running.

* Fix for bug 409708 to remove unnecessary code from Thunderbird
  script now that a few Thunderbird bugs have been fixed.

* Fix for bug 405541 to better handle Thunderbird message summary
  list in braille.

* Fix for but 408174 to make laptop keybindings work better
  (Thanks to community member Juan Ramon Jimenez for this fix!!!).

* Fixed for bug 405624 so Orca will report a label even if it was
  same as previous one.

* New and updated translations (THANKS EVERYONE!!!):

* Fix for bug 398531: handle the speech preferences tab page better.

* Fix for bug 380050: Orca windows are now focused after user
  presses "Quit" or "Preferences" button in Orca Preferences
  window.  (Thanks for testing, Joanie!)

* Work on bug 400763: much improvement to the responsiveness after
  starting an update from the update manager.

* Fix for bugs 400766 and 348464: better handling of autocomplete
  entries in GTK widgets as used by the "Run..." dialog and Evolution.

* Continued work on Gecko.py script for Firefox 3.0.  We're getting
  there step by step, and it requires work both inside Firefox 3.0
  and inside Orca.

* Updated to support latest BrlAPI.  Orca should now work various
  versions of BrlTTY and BrlAPI.

2.17.90 - 21-Jan-2007

* Much more work on the Gecko script (to support both Firefox and
Thunderbird).  Please note that this is still a work in progress
and much more work needs to be done both inside Orca and inside
Firefox and Thunderbird.  We're working very very hard.

* More work on the Thunderbird script to accommodate some unique
aspects of the Thunderbird UI.  We've also logged several bugs
with the Thunderbird folks to help address these things.

* Fix for bug 376791: Orca now provides better access to the buddy
list in Gaim 2.0.0 beta 5.

* Fix for bug 397797: Orca now exposes the language attribute of a
speech synthesizer voice to allow people to more easily disambiguate
voices.

* Fix for bug 394397: Orca now handles arrowing to the end of a line
better and prevents the line from being spoken again.

* Fix for bug 392939: "-" is now spoken spoken when used as a negative
sign at "some" punctuation.

* Fix for bug 395749: make sure we reference any_data values when we
get an event rather than waiting to work with them asynchronously.

* Added new 'attributes' field to the Python Accessible class
defined in at-spi.py.  This allows scripts to more easily access
the attributes of an AT-SPI object.

* New and updated translations (THANKS EVERYONE!!!):

2.17.5 - 07-Jan-2007

* Brand new script for Adobe Acrobat Reader from Joanie Diggs (Thanks
  Joanie!!!).  NOTE:  there are still some accessibility issues to
  be worked out with the team at Adobe, but this script helps provide
  some level of access to PDF documents via Reader.

* Much more work on Gecko.py script for Firefox 3.0.  There's still
  much more work to do in the Firefox 3.0 internals as well as the
  Gecko.py script.  We're still working feverishly on it.

* Update to outloud.py to add more voices and prevent crash when
  ViaVoice is used (thanks to community member Bart Bunting!!!)

* Adjusted bleeding edge Orca code to work with bleeding edge BrlAPI
  code.  We expect there to be one more change in BrlAPI 0.5.0 before
  it stabilizes, but it wasn't ready at the time of this release.

* Work on bug 350233 (actually an RFE): New script for the Liferea
  application from community member Francisco Javier Dorado Martínez
  (thanks Javier!!!).

* Work on bug 376517: Orca now speaks the unit of measure (pixels)
  after the left-margin and/or right-margin text attributes if they
  differ from the norm.

* Work on bug 347124: Added feature to allow user to tell gksu to
  disable keyboard grabs.  This is just one of the several pieces
  of the puzzle to help prevent hangs when launching sysadmin apps
  from the desktop of a non-root user.

* Fix for bug 393074: Repeated characters are now correctly read.
  (Thanks to Juan Ramon Jimenez for this fix!!!).

* Fix for bug 362546: Fixed problem speaking status bar contents
  (Insert+KP_Enter) when the status bar is a single component (e.g.,
  text field), rather than a container with multiple
  sub-components.

* Moved the keyboard layout to the first tab in the preferences
  dialog.

* Fix for bug 388620: Fixed wording of "not not" string.

* Fix for bug 388317: Prevent crash in Adobe Acrobat Reader (thanks
  Joanie!!!).

* Fix for bug 387556: Make arrowing to end of line in OOo consistent
  with what happens in gedit (thanks Joanie!!!).

* Fix for bug 388039: prevent stack trace when running orca -t.

* Fix for bug 386267: In Evolution, Orca now speaks/brailles the
  unread status instead of the read status in the message summary
  list.

* Fix for bug 382890: Extended dynamic row and column header support
  to OOo Writer tables.

* New and updated translations (THANKS EVERYONE!!!):

2.17.4 - 17-Dec-2006

* Added new support to edit your key bindings from the Orca
  preferences dialog (thanks Jorge Sandín <jorges@elsendero.es>!!!)

* Added new implementation of "Where Am I" based upon the discussion
  on the Orca user's list (thanks for your work, everyone!).

* Fix for bug 382891: Flat review now works in the face of empty text
  areas (thanks Joanie Diggs!!).

* Fix for bug 381391: Flat review initialization now handles
  situations where the caret is at the end of a text area (thanks
  Joanie Diggs!!).

* Fix for bug 382408: Eliminated significant sluggishness when
  navigating in OOo Writer tables (many thanks to our Orca users
  for speaking up about this!).

* Fix for bug 382495: orca --setup is now localized (thanks Takao!).

* Fix for bug 382418: Orca now announces when you enter/leave a table
  in OOo Writer documents.

* Fix for bug 382880: Orca now provides speech output when tabbing
  among cells in OOo Writer documents.

* Fix for bug 382888: Orca now announces when you cross a cell boundary
  in OOo Writer tables.

* Fix for bug 382415: Orca now honors speak cell/row setting in OOo
  Writer tables.

* Fix for bug 384393: Orca now reports bold or underline in OOo Writer
  when Insert F is pressed (this was a regression).

* Fix for bug 375395: Orca now speaks blank lines in Evolution when
  appropriate.

* Allow Orca to run better under gdm for accessible login.  With this
  work, we've been informed by the gdm maintainer that Orca is the
  first assistive technology ever that can run without requiring gdm
  to have a home directory. NOTE: the typical line to add to
  /etc/X11/gdm/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents is something like the
  following, depending upon what you want Orca to do when it starts:

  <Control>o  1 1000 10000  /bin/sh -c "GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge ctrun -l child -i none orca -n -d main-window"

* Improved support for BrlTTY v3.8.  Orca will now first attempt to
  use the new Python bindings for BrlAPI 0.5 (which is what comes with
  BrlTTY v3.8) and then fallback to its own bindings for BrlAPI 0.4.1
  (which is what comes with BrlTTY 3.7.2).  When using BrlTTY v3.8,
  Orca is now a better BrlTTY citizen: Orca only consumes BrlTTY
  events that it cares about, and Orca is also smarter about which TTY
  it chooses. NOTE: Our plan is to eventually retire Orca's BrlAPI 0.4.1
  Python bindings as BrlAPI 0.5 becomes more prevalent.

* More work done with Gecko.py (the Firefox script), but there's still
  a lot of work to do here, both on the Firefox and Orca
  implementations.

* More work done with Thunderbird, but there's still a lot more work
  to be done with it as well, both on the Firefox and Orca
  implementations.

* Improvements and additions to the Orca regression test harness.

* New and updated translations (THANKS!):

2.17.3 - 03-Dec-2006

* Implementation of RFE 373566: Added support to switch between
  desktop and laptop bindings.  Also added support for allowing the
  Caps Lock key to act as the Orca modifier.

* Added feature to the preferences dialog to present the key bindings
  as progress towards RFE 354970.  Many thanks to Jorge Sandín for
  this work!

* Implementation of RFE 354463 - The "Find" command is now working,
  with the exception of bug 381391.  Many thanks to Joanie Diggs for
  her hard work on this!

* Implementation of RFE 376002: Added command line options to tell
  Orca to start with speech, braille, and/or magnification.  This
  is mostly to aid things such as accessible installs and logins.

* Work on RFE 371122: much of the "Where am I" command has been
  implemented, though we're still testing and refining it.

* A fair amount of work has been done on the Gecko script for Firefox 3.
  Please note this is still a work in progress and is still somewhat
  unstable.  The Orca and Firefox teams are working feverishly on the
  support and are still targeting Firefox 3 for compelling web
  access.

* Continued work on identifying (and resolving when possible) accessibility
  issues in other applications.  Please do a search on the "orca" component
  at http://bugzilla.gnome.org for summaries containing the "[blocked]"
  string to get a list.

* In the callback for the Cancel button on the Orca Preferences
  window, the code has been adjusted to destroy that window, so that
  the next time the user displays the Preferences dialog, all of the
  settings will reflect the current running state rather than how the
  user left the GUI components before hitting the Cancel button.

* Fix for bug 372808: Orca now reports the appropriate header
  information when tabbing between tables.

* Fix for bug 377085: family-name text attribute are no longer
  malformed for multi-word family names.

* Implementation of RFE 377955: Suggested additions to pronunciation
  dictionary.

* Fix for bug 376347: Orca no longer speaks new-line in the
  Evolution menu bar.

* Fix for bug 372964: Added text-attribute settings.

* Fix for bug 376006: Handle minimum increment value of 0.0 when
  calculating decimal places to present for sliders.

* Fix for bug 358467: Mapped the time-admin to the users-admin
  script so that Orca can correctly read the table of time servers.

* Change for bug 364529. Initial value in the Preferences Glade file
  for pitch is now 5.0 and not 9.0.  Also allow voice styles to be
  undefined.  The hypertext link voice will now initially derive
  its values from the default voice settings.

* Partial fix for bug 356060: Provide access to tree item level and
  state in OOo Navigator.

* Defensive fix for bug 353432: Orca no longer announces name changes
  for objects who tell us their name has changed when it really
  hasn't.

* Work on bug 363815: Implement the ability to have application
  specific settings.

* Fix for bug 364452: make sure Orca's name shows up as "orca" and not
  "-c" in at-poke.

* Fix for bug 319666: Orca now announces "0 items" when encountering
  various empty objects.

* Fix for bug 381653: Orca now announces the new state of a checkbox
  when it is changed inside a table cell.

* More work on the specification and regression test suite.

* New and updated translations (THANKS!):

2.17.2 - 05-Nov-2006

* Updates to requirements and specifications documents.

* Fair amount of work on Gecko.py script, though it is not at all ready
  for compelling access to Firefox (and hence the web) yet.  Also did
  a fair amount of work looking at flat review and filing a number of
  bugs against the AT-SPI implementation in progress in Firefox 3.

* Fix for bug 369292: gcalctool now speaks the new result when
  the "=" button is activated.

* Fix for bug 337063: Orca now supports an alternate .orca location via
  the -u and --user-prefs-dir command line options.

* Fix for bug 365939: reading of message list in Evolution now provides
  more concise information for check box items.

  also fixed the "backspace" problem in gnome-terminal.

* Workaround for bug 368626: prevent gnome-panel from crashing and add
  some defensive code to work in the case where there is no event
  source in an at-spi event.

* Fix for bug 338838: Orca now speaks "newline" only when moving by
  character or word.

* Fix for bug 358467: Orca now reads check items status
  in "Users and groups" dialog of users-admin application.

* Fix for bug 355733: SayAll function now works better for OpenOffice.

* Fix for bug 364086: Orca no longer reports "paragraph 0 paragraph"
  when you begin typing in a OpenOffice Calc cell.

  column headers are set.  In addition, column numbers in OpenOffice
  Calc are now spoken as column letters.

* Fix for bug 363807: Orca now reports the number of items in a table.

* Fix for bug 321184: Orca now supports a custom pronunciation dictionary.

* Fix for bug 363802: Orca no longer says "cell" when navigating from
  cell to cell in OpenOffice Calc.

* Fix for bug 363796: Second press of a letter in learn mode now provides
  the phonetic ("military") spelling of the letter.

* Fix for bug 355525: Orca handled EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs in text
  better.

* Fix for bug 357063: If there are a bunch of repeated characters
  (like the greater thans) on a line that also has text, Orca respects the
  punctuation settings in Orca.  But, if the repeated characters are on
  a line by themselves (i.e.  30 greater thans, nothing else), Orca
  indicates their presence ("30 greater than characters") regardless
  of the level of punctuation.

* Fix for bug 344249: Orca reports menu mnemonics as part of the
  "Where am I" functionality.

* Fix for bug 348975: the state for radio buttons is now spoken prior
  to the role.

  down.

  column of text in OOo Writer documents.

* Fix for bug 357829: Use real active descendant of a table cell when
  looking for locus of focus in flat review.

* Fix for bug 341406: Orca now presents results when finding files.

* Fix for bug 319783: Orca now speaks/brailles the insensitive states
  of objects if they are insensitive.

  toggleable via Insert-m.

* Fix for bug 361670: flat review no longer fails after minimizing the
  Orca main window.

* Fix for bug 355893: Network Preferences "Port" label is now reported
  by Orca.

2.17.1 - 14-Oct-2006

* Implemented RFE 361167: add use of Insert+r and Insert+c as a means
  to specify dynamic column headers and dynamic row headers in Open
  Office spreadsheets.

* Fixed bug 361747: provide support for the 'weight' text attribute.
  Also make sure that character text attributes are handled correctly.

* Implemented RFE 319657: In gedit, Orca now speaks the context of
  search ('find') results.

* Implemented RFE 339789: Added code to "Where Am I" to report the
  number of items in menus and submenus as well as the current
  position of a menu item or menu in its menu.

* Fix for bug 350523: In gcalctool, give reference to accessible name
  of a button over the text that is being displayed on a button.

* Added use of Python logging API to log speech and braille at the
  INFO level.  This will dovetail in with the larger testing work
  being done for GNOME.

* Fix for bug 350219: provide announcement when you create a new
  document for the very first time in Open Office.

* Fix for bug 354785: read the entire line in the "Process Fields"
  preferences table in gnome-system-monitor. Fix involved a rework
  of how table cells are brailled and spoken.

* Fix for bug 349954: do not make assumptions that UTF-8 strings
  contain only single byte characters.  Handle this by converting
  to the Python unicode type before doing processing such as
  string length and character analysis.

* Added 'getText' method to script to provide a means for the script
  to work around shortcomings in some accessible text implementations.

* Exploratory work on the Gecko.py script to help debug and provide
  an understanding of what the Gecko AT-SPI implementation is providing
  us.

* Added ZONE support for goBegin and goEnd functions of flat review
  (thanks Joanie Diggs!)

* Improvements to the test harness.  NOTE: as a result of the GNOME
  Boston 2006 Accessibility Summit, we may revise this harness as
  the overall testing strategy for GNOME develops.

* New and updated translations (THANKS!):

2.17.0 - 04-Oct-2006

* Updates to user requirements and functional specification.

* Added Orca man pages.

* New and improved regression test harness.

* Added new Orca main window to allow one to have a GUI option for
  quitting Orca and invoking the configuration settings.  The appearance
  of this window can be enabled/disabled in the new "General" tab
  of the configuration dialog.  Also added "Apply" button the configuration
  GUI window.

* Added new Orca "Quit" dialog.

* Refactor in default.py and other scripts to add isTextArea method to
  determine if an object is a text area or not.  This allows us to deal
  with the growing number of things that are text areas, but choose to
  give themselves different roles (e.g., GTK's 'text', OpenOffice's
  'paragraph', and Gecko's 'entry').

* Added Gecko.py toolkit script to cover apps that use the Mozilla
  Gecko toolkit (e.g., Firefox, Thunderbird, Yelp, etc.).  Some work
  done with new Firefox 3 at-spi implementation, but much work is
  still needed.

* Added repeated character count handling (rfe/bug 354469).

* Added military spelling (rfe/bug 354460).

* Fix for bug 351957: Orca now allows the setting of the source and target
  displays for magnification.

* Fix for bug 351569: no longer hang when gnome-keyring password box
  appears.

* Fix for bug 344192: no longer hang when the "bug buddy" dialog
  appears.

* Fix for bug 355602: $ was being echoed twice in terminal with word
  echo enabled.

  spelling out the 'No focus' message.

* Fix for bug 358508: use obj instead of event.source in
  visualAppearanceChanged for speech.

* Fix for bug 353532: provide a workaround for a java-access-bridge
  bug (bug 355011) where popup menu events are not sent to Orca.

* Fix for bug 353531: 'checked'/'unchecked' are no longer reported
  twice for check boxes in java applications.

* Fix for bug 357556: Insert key no longer sticks after running test
  keystroke files. The hot-key to start/stop recording of keystrokes
  within Orca has been reverted to just "Pause".  Also adjusted the
  "don't write pause keystrokes" code to recognize F21 (which is the
  Pause key on my Sun type 6 keyboard).

* Partial work on bug 354970: add command_name dictionary from Jorge
  Sandin (thanks Jorge!).  Also refactored the way keybindings and
  braille bindings are defined and obtained to make it easier to
  discover and override their definitions.

* Partial work on bug 349954: become more cognizant of multibyte UTF-8
  characters.

* Fix for bug 357509: Flat review now uses the "uppercase" voice
  settings for uppercase text when navigating by line.

* Fix for bug 357507: SayAll now uses the "uppercase" voice settings
  for uppercase text.

* Fix for bug 356970: repeated character count now works with Evolution

* Fix for bug 356911: Orca no longer generates a traceback with
  Numpad-Minus when positioned at the end of a line.

* Fix for bug 356179: the test in Orca to determine if the desktop
  is running now works better.

* Fix for bug 340849: Orca now provides an option to allow the user to
  automatically logout of the GNOME desktop if the gconf accessibility
  flag wasn't previously enabled before running the setup utility.

* Fix for bug 355927: duplicate window titles are now spoken when
  navigating between them using Alt+Tab.

* Fix for bug 350216: "LAYERED_PANE" is no longer in speech context.

* Fix for bug 351797: make sure configuration GUI pops to top.

* Fix for bug 347128: allow pan buttons to be used on braille display
  while in learn mode.

* Fix for bug 347650: allow a script to determine if it is the active
  script or not (compare self to orca_state.activeScript).

* For for bug 354983: From Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com> (THANKS!) - fill
  in dead code paths in brlmodule.c.

* Fix for bug 354487: apostrophe no longer delimits a word boundary.

* Fix for bug 354985: gedit script no longer generates a traceback due to
  a missing import line.

* Fix for bug 342602: StarOffice Writer table cell speaking order fixed.

0.9.0 - 21-Aug-2006

* Updates to the requirements guide and input and output style guides.

* For regression testing purposes, allow us to get what would have
been spoken even if settings.speechServerFactory is None.

* Improvements to the "orca" shell script.  Provides better
availability and also provides a better means for killing/restarting
Orca.

* New orca.desktop file and icon.

* New latent support to allow the setting of the source and target
displays for magnification.  If it exists,
settings.magnifierTargetDisplay will be treated as an X Window System
DISPLAY string (e.g., ":0.1") that says where to display the magnified
area (the default is split screen magnification on the primary
display).  If it exists, settings.magnifierSourceDisplay will be
treated as an X Window System DISPLAY string (e.g., ":0.0") that says
what is to be magnified.

* Many thanks to our friends at Baum for providing many fixes and testing
for the Java platform:

   * Fix for bug 351891: provide better handling when receiving an
     active descendant changed for an object with no active
     descendant.

   * Fix for bug 350740: report combo box selection change for Java
     applications.

   * Fix for bug 350736: better presentation for focused lists in Java
     applications.

   * Fix for bug 350724: improve handling of LABEL_FOR and LABELLED_BY
     objects.

   * Fix for bug 351914: provide better support for combo boxes on
     Java platform.

   * Fix for bug 352233: prevent exception when getting the child of
     an object from a Java application.

   * Fix for bug 352238: do not assume last input event was a keyboard
     event.

* Fix for bug 350213: provide defensive programming for combo box
braille generator.

* Fix for bug 351501: do not generate a traceback when trying to
braille Evolution message folder tree.

* Fix for bug 350854: handle object:state-changed:focused events so
Orca will recognize when GEdit's edit area has focus again after a
maximize/unmaxmize of GEdit's window on GNOME 2.15/16.

* Fix for bug 352073: provide "gnome-python with bonobo" hint for
missing dependency.  Also provide a note at the end providing a more
obvious message when support for BrlTTY/BrlAPI cannot be found.

* Fix for bug 351847: add defensive code in the event the AT-SPI
implementation gives us a cycle when looking at the
RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF relation.

* Fix for bug 349465: take some defensive actions in the event that
the AT-SPI implementation has implemented getTextAtOffset incorrectly
(i.e., it gives back garbage for offsets).

* Fix for bug 350218: GtkDemo Editable cells tree demo no longer
speaks both cells in a row

* Fix for bug 350294: Eliminate TypeError in _initGUIState in GUI prefs.

* Fix for bug 350212: Improve speaking of Spin Button changes.

0.2.8 - 06-Aug-2006
* Orca has been approved for inclusion into GNOME 2.16!!!  YEAH!
  Thanks everyone for your support.
* Many thanks also to the team from Baum for their contributions in
  improving the support for the Java platform.
* Much improvement in the reliability and availability department.
  Thanks very much to community members for helping test Orca and
  provide us with constructive feedback and informative bug reports.
  These community members include: Joanmarie Diggs, Al Puzzuoli,
  Fco. Javier Dorado Martínez, and Cody Hurst.
* Improvements to Yelp access.
* Improvements to Firefox 2 chrome.  NOTE: we are targeting Firefox 3
  as the means for providing compelling access to web content.
* The main 'orca' executable is now a shell script that launches the
  Python process for orca.  It includes some utilities to clean up
  stray processes and latent support to automatically detect failures
  in Orca and restart it if necessary.  We will be improving this
  script prior to the GNOME 2.16 release.  Your testing and feedback
  will be helpful!
* Improved support for the emacspeak speech service, including better
  ACSS support for DECtalk and overall support for rate/pitch
  parameters.  Many thanks to Joanmarie Diggs for her contributions to
  this space.  The community model works!
* Fix for bug 347691: In standard print dialog, printer table items
  not always spoken/displayed.
* Fix for bug 345462: Orca should speak changes when moving up a level
  in menus.
* Fix for bug 341371: Orca will not report the file name in file
  picker when there is only one file existing in current folder.
* Fix for bug 319738: The child routine() needs to be more careful
  about indices out of bounds.
* Fix for bug 319660: Exiting learn mode should display current locus
  of focus.
* Fix for bug 348980: Get braille cursor routing keys working again.
* Fix for bug where window activated and deactivated events can arrive
  out of order.  Thanks to Baum for this fix!
* Defensive programming in the event that expected object specializations
  (e.g., text, component, selection, etc.) don't exist.  Thanks to Baum
  for this fix!
* Created orca.desktop to add orca to menu items.
* Migrated to LINGUAS model (http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/PoLinguas).
* Added additional testing and debugging utilities.  Also added
  additional helper lines to ~/.orca/user-settings.py that make
  it more convenient to turn on/off various debugging and testing
  utilities.
* Pychecker fixes and also eliminated circular imports in the python
  modules.
* Additional keystrokes files for testing.  We're ramping up our regression
  tests and hope to have a more complete set by the GNOME 2.16
  release.
* Provide smoother handling of the crosswires and cursor in the
  magnifier when tracking the mouse.

0.2.7 - 24-Jul-2006
* Much work on hangs.  It's better, but we still have work to do.
* Vastly improved work with GAIM.  Also added Insert+{1,2,3,...} to
  allow you to read the last n messages.
* Fix bug 348084 - fail gracefully if speech is not available.
* Handle situations where the label the label for a FILLER or PANEL is
  done by placing an unbound label as the first child of the
  FILLER/PANEL and the content of the FILLER/PANEL is the second
  child.
* Fix bug 348131 - make SayAll perform properly in Evolution.
* Moved the Orca specific keybindings out of the init() routine in
  orca.py over to the setupInputEventHandlers and getKeyBindings()
  routines in default.py.
* Reworked how Orca handles "no focus."  It is much better now.
* Added new keynames for various keys.
* Fixed bug #347228 - correctly identify state of top level item in
  some tree tables.
* Improved access to Evolution and StarOffice set up wizards.
* Additional work on access to the Java platform.

  configuration wizards.
* Additional work on Evolution to better support configuration wizards.
* Very preliminary support for the Java platform.
* Moved a number of utilities from various places to util.py.
* Moved http server support into its own module.  Note that
  orca.settings.speechServerPort is now defunct and has been replaced
  by orca.settings.httpServerPort.
* Fixes for reading table row and column headers.
* Fix for bug 347054 to allow readTableCellRow and speechVerbosityLevel
  settings to be set properly from the configuration GUI.
* Fix for bug 343897 to allow configuration GUI to pop to top when it
  is shown.  This requires a more recent version of PyGTK (2.9.3) to work.
* Fix for bug 341388 to stop speech for an object when its window loses focus.
* Fixes for bug 343133 to do defensive programming in flat review to
  help prevent hangs.
* Fix for bug 345472 to not assume the last input event was a keyboard event.

0.2.5 - 11-Jun-2006
* Re-map keyboard bindings and add additional keyboard bindings.
  See http://live.gnome.org/Orca/KeyboardCommands for the list.
* Improvements to StarOffice support to provide better access to text
  documents and spreadsheets.  Also get rid of spurious "0.00" text
  that was showing up in braille for StarOffice buttons.
* Addition of announcing text selection as it is selected and unselected.
* Generalize the "read table cell row" functionality.  If you press
  Insert+F11, it will toggle the feature to read the entire row of
  a table or just the selected table cell when you move from row to row.
* Improved support for SayAll of text objects (SayAll for flat review
  is still on the to do list).
* Addition of self-voicing module to tell Orca to be quiet when a
  self-voicing application is present.
* Addition of ability to turn Orca into a speech server that can
  accessed via simple HTTP commands (default port is 20433, but this
  is customizable via orca.settings.speechServerPort).  This will
  allow self-voicing applications to use Orca for their speech, thus
  letting them get the user's speech settings preferences.
* Addition of orca.settings.enableBrailleGrouping (default=False).
  NOTE: this represents a change in the UI for Orca - the behavior to
  date has been to always group menu items on the braille display.
  The system responsiveness was bad for large menus, however, so we
  decided to make this an optional feature turned off by default.
* Addition of utility to report information on the currently active
  script.  This is primarily for helping script writers do debugging
  and is accessed by pressing Insert+F3.
* Addition of orca.settings.cacheAccessibles (default=True) as a
  means to turn the local caching of accessible objects on or off.
  This is primarily an orca developer debugging feature.
* Fix for bug 344218 - gnome-terminal would not be presented properly
  if it was started after Orca.
* Fix for bug 343666: pressing buttons on braille displays could cause
  a hang.
* Partial fix for bug 342022 - provide some defensive mechanisms to help
  prevent some hangs.
* Fix for bug 343133 - do not hang when doing a flat-review of a man
  page in gnome-terminal.
* Fix for bug #343013 - the command line option strings should not be
  translatable.
* Partial fix for bug 319652 - become a better Python thread citizen

0.2.4 - 15-May-2006
* Addition of text and GUI preferences configuration tools.
  NOTE: 0.2.4 eliminates orca-setup and replaces it with the
  "--setup" (GUI or text, depending upon your environment),
  "--gui-setup" (GUI), "--text-setup" (text), "--no-setup"
  (bypass any automatic setup mechanism - useful for running
  with gdm accessible login) command line options to the
  "orca" command.  You can also bring up the GUI while orca
  is running by pressing Insert+space.
  WARNING: 0.2.4 also introduces an incompatible change to
  the configuration file and requires you to "rm -rf ~/.orca"
  and rerun orca setup.
* Fix for bug 340662 - do not require the desktop to be running
  to set up orca preferences.
* Addition of support for magnification similar to that in
  Gnopernicus.
* Fix for bug 331512 - addition of key and word echo.  We need
  community feedback on this.
* Work on specifying the external dependencies for building
  and running Orca.
* Fix for bug where metacity workspaces (accessed via
  Ctrl+Alt+Arrow) were being announced as inaccessible.
* Work on dealing with the Java platform giving us
  CORBA::Unknown objects instead of Bonobo::Unknown objects.
  Java platform support, however, still has a long way to go.
* Work on coping with CORBA COMM_FAILURES a little better.
* Fix for bug 338097 - better support for the "planner"
  application.
* Work for bug 338890 - add ""--version" option to orca to
  output the version.  Orca also now uses the getopt facility
  to get command line options.
* Fix for bug 340773 - focus events were interrupting the
  automatic reading of dialog boxes.
* Fix for bug 340625 - better handling of table cells.
* Fix for bugs 340559, 337371 - reduce repetitive output of
  slider values.
* Fix for bug 319732 - move .label logic from atspi.spi to
  something that can be more easily overridden by scripts.
* Fix for bug 340481 - combo box updates were not being
  handled correctly.
* Fix for bug 340305 - combo box labels were not being presented.
* Fix for bug 340556 - radio button group names were not being
  presented.
* Fix for bug 338839 - allow speech to be enabled/disabled using
  Insert+s.
* Fix for bug 339932 - shutdown orca better on Ctrl+C from
  the command line.
* Fix for bug 339927 - use floating point values for speech
  rate, gain, and pitch to provide finer granularity of settings.
* Fix for bug 341415 - attempt to listen for AT-SPI events and
  present accessible information even if no accessible windows
  are active when orca starts.
* Work on bug 340849 - automatically enable desktop accessibility
  if needed and remind the user to log out and log back in for
  this to take effect.
* Additions to and development of the test plan.
