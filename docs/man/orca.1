.SH NAME
orca \- a scriptable screen reader
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B orca
.RI [ option... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B orca
is a screen reader for people with visual impairments,
it provides alternative access to the desktop by using speech synthesis and braille.
.P
.B orca
works with applications and toolkits that support
the Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI), which
is the primary assistive technology infrastructure for Linux and
Solaris. Applications and toolkits supporting the AT-SPI include the
GNOME Gtk+ toolkit, the Java platform's Swing toolkit, LibreOffice,
Gecko, and WebKitGtk. AT-SPI support for the KDE Qt toolkit is being
pursued.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI "\-u, --user-prefs-dir=" dirname

.TP
.B \-l, --list-apps
Prints the names of all the currently running applications.  This
is used primarily for debugging purposes to see if
.B orca
can talk to the accessibility infrastructure.  Note that if
.B orca
is already running, this will not kill the other
.B orca
process.  It will just list the currently running applications,
and you will see
.B orca
listed twice: once for the existing
.B orca
and once for this instance.
.TP

Enables debug output for
.B orca
and sends all debug output to a file with a name of the

The YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS portion will be replaced with the current
date and time.

process.  By default, if
.BR orca
detects an existing
.BR orca

.BR orca
process.  This option will kill and cleanup after any existing
.BR orca
process and then start a new
.BR orca
in its place.
.TP

.SH KEYBOARD SETTINGS

key is
