  <chapter id="userrequirements"><title>User Requirements and
    Functional Description</title>

    <para>Based upon discussions with end users as well as the tasks
      and ideas from the &personaslink;, Orca must supply at least the
      following end-user features.</para>

    <section id="uravailable"><title>Availability at All Times</title>

      <para>Orca will often be the only vehicle by which many users
        will be able to access the system.  As such, it must be
        available at all times, including at system login and
        screen-saver screens.</para>

      <para>Orca must also be available after the system returns from
        "standby" or "sleep" mode.</para>

      <para>Finally, in the event the user's choice of speech synthesis
        engine becomes unavailable (e.g., expired license), Orca must
        attempt to find and use an alternative synthesis engine.</para>

      <section><title>Functional Description and Status</title>

        <para>&complete; V0.2.2. LOGIN: Orca will rely upon the accessible
          login feature of gdm to enable access at login.  This
          feature has been tested and verified on Open Solaris with
          Orca V0.2.2.</para>

        <para>&complete; V0.2.2. SCREEN SAVER: Orca will announce that
	  the "AT Enabled Lock Dialog" is active and you can type your
	  password.</para>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="urresilient"><title>Failure Resiliency</title>

      <para>In the event that Orca fails or a component of the
        system that Orca depends upon fails, the system should be able
        to heal (and perhaps restart) itself appropriately.</para>

      <section><title>Functional Description and Status</title>

        <para>&complete; V0.9.0.  Orca provides a script that will
	restart Orca in the event of catastrophic failure, and it also
	periodically pings and restarts Orca if necessary.
	Furthermore, Orca will also detect hangs inside itself and
	quit if possible.</para>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="urkeynav"><title>Seamless Interaction with Traditional Keyboard Navigation
      Methods</title>
      <para>Orca must allow users to navigate through the desktop and
        applications on the desktop using the system keyboard
        navigation gestures (e.g., Alt+Tab to select the next window).
        In other words, Orca must not interfere with traditional
        keyboard navigation.</para>

      <section><title>Functional Description and Status</title>

        <para>&complete; V0.2.3. Orca defines keystrokes for the keypad
          and also makes special used of the "Insert" key as the Orca
          modifier key.  Orca also provides an "orcaModifierKeys"
          customization setting to allow the user to override the Orca
          modifier key.  This setting contains a list of key strings
          that represent the key to be used as the Orca modifier key.
          See the &ugcustomizationlink; section of the &userguidelink;
          for more information.</para>

        <para>&complete; V0.2.2. Furthermore, while the keystrokes
          generally do not interfere with normal and traditional
          keyboard navigation techniques built into the desktop, these
          keystrokes can be overridden and extended if necessary.  See
          the &ugcustomizationlink; section of the &userguidelink; for
          more information.</para>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section id="urinteroperable"><title>Seamless Interaction with Other Assistive
      Technologies</title>

      <para>It is not uncommon for users to simultaneously use other
        assistive technologies, such as the AccessX features of XKB
        <citation><xref linkend="accessx"
        endterm="accessx.abbrev"/></citation>, to access their displays.
        As such, Orca must be able to co-exist (i.e., not interfere)
        with other assistive technologies in use by the user.</para>

      <section><title>Functional Description and Status</title>

        <para>&complete; V0.9.0. [OWNER: LMS] Orca has been simultaneously
          tested with BrlTTY, GOK, and Dasher and AccessX.</para>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section id="urstyle"><title>Consistent Style</title>

      <para> It is expected that access to applications will be driven
        primarily via customized "scripts," with a fallback
        ("default") script to be used in the absence of a customized
        script.</para>

      <para>While each script can provide dramatically different
        access to an application, it is expected that scripts will
        provide a users with a consistent style to access
        applications.  To help with this consistent style, Orca will
        provide a &styleguidelink;, a well-documented "default"
        script, and several application scripts that demonstrate and
        promote this style.
      </para>

      <section><title>Functional Description and Status</title>

        <para>&complete; V0.9.0. Orca currently provides a
	  &styleguidelink; and a <literal>default.py</literal> script

      </section>

    </section>

    <section id="urscripting"><title>Customizable Behavior Per Application 
      ("Scripting")</title>
      <para>It is expected that the default behavior will provide
        reasonable access to all applications that use the AT-SPI.
        However, to provide dramatically improved access, Orca must be
        able to provide customized behavior for individual
        applications.</para>
      <para>For example, one can envision a script for an e-mail
        application that can provide prioritized access to one's
        inbox.  Another example may be that the script provides
        keyboard access to select and copy displayed text to the
        system clipboard in the event the application doesn't support
        this (e.g., the only way to select text in a terminal window
        is to use a mouse - a script might create new keybindings to
        allow a user to do this from the keyboard).</para>

      <section><title>Functional Description and Status</title>

        <para>&complete; V0.2.4.  Orca provides a framework for both
	  per-application and per-toolkit customized scripts.  This
	  framework is documented in the &scriptguidelink;.</para>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section id="urscripters"><title>Support for Script Writers</title>

      <para>Orca will provide tools and utilities to help the script
        writer.  These utilities not only include a library of useful
        methods to use from scripts, but also runtime tools to help
        the script writer analyze the system in action.</para>

      <section><title>Firefox details</title>
        <para>FF3 should at least provide the following
        functionality.  For character and word navigation, Firefox
        should honor the standard well known keystrokes such as Left and
        Right arrows or Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right arrows for moving by
        character and word.  When the user reaches the beginning or
        end of a line they should wrap to the next or previous line.  
        If the user reaches the beginning or end of a frame they should wrap
        to the next or previous frame.</para>

	<para>When up and down arrowing orca should as closely as
        possible move by line in the web page.  If the line contains
        links, orca should speak the word "link" after the link.  If
        possible, the link should also be underlined with dots 7 and 8
        on the braille display.</para>

	<para>If the line contains form controls, the label for the
        control should be read followed by the role.  If the role is
        a text entry area and the user has placed the cursor at the location
        where text can be entered, the user should also hear
        "editable".  The braille user will see the cursor followed by
        "edit".</para>

	<para>When tabbing and shift tabbing between elements the user
        should hear the element followed by the role.  If a user
        encounters a combo he/she should be able to press "space" to
        expand the control in order to make a selection.  When space
        is pressed again to make the selection the control will close
        allowing the user to continue moving through the page.</para>

        <para>If tab or shift+tab is pressed while a control is opened, it
        will be closed and focus will move to the next element.</para>

	<para>Check boxes and buttons will simply be toggled by space
        as they are in any other application.</para>

	<para> The letters "h" and "Shift+h" will
        be used to move between headings.  When the heading is
        reached, orca will speak and braille the header followed by
        "heading and the heading level.  The numbers 1 through 6 will
        also be available to allow the user to move to the next
        heading at that level.</para>

	<para>The letters "t" and "Shift+t" will be used to move
        between tables.  When the table is reached its title will be
        spoken as well as the value of the cell with focus.
        Shift+Alt+{Left,Right,Up,Down} will be used to move from cell
        to cell.  Shift+Alt+{Home,End} will be used to move between the
        beginning and the end of the current table.  When changing
        column or row, the appropriate headings should also be
        read.</para>

	<para>The keys "orca+tab" and "shift+orca+tab"  will be used to move
        between form fields.</para>

	<para>The letters "l" and "Shift+l" will allow the user to
        move from list to list.</para>

	<para>The letters "u" and "v" will be used to
        move between unvisited and visited links.</para>

	<para>The letters "o" and "Shift+o" will be used to move
	between large objects.  Large objects can be things such as:
	headings, paragraphs, and tables.  For this feature, links and
	form controls will not be considered large objects.</para>
      </section>

      <section><title>Verbalized Links spec</title>
        <para>When moving between lines in an office document and the
        line contains one or more links orca should speak the word
        link after the link.  If the "link" voice is specified, the
        link should be read using the link voice.  This functionality
        should also be available in "say all" mode.  In braille the
        link should always be underlined using dots 7 and 8.  If the
        user moves by character or word, the word "link" will not be
        repeatedly spoken.  If the user double presses insert+f to get
        detailed information on a character they will be informed that
        the character is part of a link.</para>

    <section id="urcustomizable"><title>Configurable Presentation and Interaction</title>
      <para>Different users have different capabilities (e.g., some
        may be able to hear some synthesis voices better than others;
        some may use braille while others do not) and desires (e.g.,
        some may prefer faster speaking rates).  As such, the general
        manner and means by which Orca presents information to the
        user must be configurable by the end user.</para>
      <para>Users must also be able to change configuration settings
        while Orca is running, including the ability to turn
        presentation modes (i.e., speech, braille, magnification) on
        or off without the need to restart Orca.</para>

    <section id="urfocustrack"><title>Focus Tracking as the Default Mode</title>
      <para>Known as "focus tracking," Orca must provide a mode
        to track the current region of interest, which is usually the
        object that has keyboard focus.</para>
      <para>When first starting up and when the region of interest has
        changed, Orca must provide a short summary of the region of
        interest, and must also provide a mechanism for the user to
        obtain more detailed information.  The presentation will
        follow the &styleguidelink;.</para>
      <para>When navigating text areas in a character-by-character or
        word-by-word fashion (or any linear fashion for that matter),
        Orca must provide an option to play an audio cue when the
        caret crosses line boundaries.  This will be looked at in a future release.</para>

    <section id="urflatreview"><title>Flat Review Mode</title>
      <para>Orca must provide the ability for a user to review the
        contents of the desktop or a given application.  This is
        typically done by the user making a &wkc; indicating "review,"
        with Orca reacting by presenting the area to be reviewed.  At
        any time, the user can interrupt the review mode, causing
        presentations such as speech output to stop
        immediately.</para>
      <para>Another option for review mode includes the ability to
        use a set of &wkc;s to quickly skim the contents of the
        display.</para>
      <para>Play audio cues across line boundaries.</para>
      <para>In addition, when in flat review mode, Orca will
        optionally allow the mouse to follow the object of interest.  This feature will be toggled by a checkbox in the general tab of the orca config UI.</para>
      <para>If the user is moving the mouse with flat review they will also be able to move by small increments.  If the user holds down shift while pressing flat review up, down, character previus or next they will move the mouse 5 pixels in that direction.

        <para>&incomplete; When autocomplete appears when a user is typing he or she is not alerted to the fact that this information has appeared.  As soon as the information pops up the first option should be spoken/brailled.  If the user continues typing and the first choice changes this should also be spoken.  It is not expected that the user would hear all possibilitys just the first.  If the user can arrow up or down through choices orca should track this as in any other list or combo.  It is okay if this information overrides the typing echo.</para>
<para>&complete; The user should be able to dinamically set a row or column as a header in openoffice calc.  The hot keys for defining this will be insert+r for row and insert+c for column.  In order to set a row or column the user should first set focus to the row or column that they wish to define and then press the appropriate hot key.  Once the user has defined a row or column it will be used to first speak this header when moving between rows or columns.  This will behave similar to the way orca reads headers in the evolution mail list when moving focus from column to column.  For example, if row c is defined as headers the appropriate cell will first be read before reading the cell with focus when the column is changed.  If a row or column is already set, double pressing the row or column definition on that row or column will unset it as a dinamic header.</para>

	If the string is found (e.g., the string matches the
	accessible name of an object or the string matches a string in
	a text area), Orca will switch to "review mode" and make the
	associated object the object of interest.  From this point,
	the user can use a &wkc;  to go back to the object with focus,
	give the found object focus if possible, or perform the
	equivalent of a mouse click on the found object.  This feature should also support (shift+KP_Delete) to search backword. </para>
      <para>In the event the user is a magnification user, the magnifier

      <para>The search will be performed in the text flow of the

	type, text string, or a combination of both.</para>
<para> The dialog will appear as follows; The first control will be the edit field to type the string to be found. The second will be a group of radio buttons to specify if the search is to be performed from the top or from the current position.

            The combination of {voice, pitch, rate, volume} will be
            known as a "voice style."  Orca will provide the user with

            various speaking operations (e.g., default, uppercase,
            warning, alarm, etc.), and may also provide unique "voice

            (e.g., focus tracking, review mode, etc.).  At a minimum,

      <para>Orca must provide a set of options to allow the user to
        enable the automatic speaking of keys as they are typed,
        alphanumeric characters as they are entered/deleted, and words
        as they are entered.  The speech much be interruptable at any
        time.</para>

      <section><title>Functional Description and Status</title>

        <para>There are be two main options for selecting key and
          word echo: key and word.  These are not mutually
          exclusive.</para>

	<para>Regardless of any setting, if the user deletes a
	  character using the Backspace or Delete keys, the next or
	  previous visible character will be spoken, depending upon
	  which key was used.  If action key echo is enabled (see
	  below), the key causing the deletion should be spoken before
	  the visible character is spoken.</para>

        <para>Key echo applies to the entire keyboard and is for
          echoing keys as they are pressed.  The keys are broken into
          the following groups that the user can optionally enable for
          echoing:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
	    <para>Alphanumeric and punctuation keys: typing keys that
	      print something on the display, with the exception of
	      space.</para>
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
	    <para>Modifier keys: CTRL, ALT, Shift, Insert, and "Fn" on laptops.</para>
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
	    <para>Locking keys: Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock, etc.</para>
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
	    <para>Function keys: The keys at the top of the keyboard.</para>
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
	    <para>Action keys: space, enter, escape, tab, backspace,
              delete, arrow keys, page up, page down, etc.</para>
	  </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>When a key from any enabled group is pressed, the key
          will be spoken.  In the case where a combination of keys is
          pressed, the entire combination should be spoken if the
          group any one of the combined keys has been enabled. For
          example, if you press Shift+f10 and modifiers are to be
          spoken but function keys are not the user should hear "shift
          f ten".</para>

        <para>The echoing of alphanumeric and punctuation keys for
          editable text areas is specialized in that it works with the
          visible text being edited (e.g., one does not hear the
          physical keys being typed when a user is entering a password
          - instead one hears the characters being added or removed
          from the text area).  When typing in editable text areas,
          the alphanumeric and punctuation key echo behaves as
          follows: If key echo is enabled, inserted characters caused
          by typing alphanumeric and punctuation keys will be spoken
          when they are inserted.  &detail; this refers to the total
          visual change in the text area as the result of a single
          user action, which may or may not have a simple and direct
          mapping to the AT-SPI text events.</para>

        <para>Word echo applies to editable text areas only, and
          behaves the following way: If word echo is enabled, words
          will be spoken when the user enters a visible change that
          depicts a word boundary (e.g., punctuation, new line,
          whitespace).  Both the word and the boundary character will
          be sent to speech output, and a separate speech output
          setting (e.g., verbalized punctuation) will be used to
          determine whether to speak the boundary character or
          not.</para>

        <para>Furthermore, if either word or alphanumeric key echo are
	  enabled, Orca will provide the following behavior:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If word or alphanumeric key echo are enabled, any
              single character surrounded by whitespace (including
              punctuation) will be spoken.  For example, if the user
              has typed "this .", "period" will be spoken when the
              user inserts a whitespace character.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If word or alphanumeric key echo are enabled, any
	      group of punctuation characters typed in a row will be
	      spoken one at a time when the user inserts a whitespace
	      character.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>OPTIONAL: if the user presses the "escape" key in a
	      text area and the text area reverts the text back to

            the time the next utterance is to be spoken must be
            minimal (e.g., less than 30ms).</para>

        <note><title>Performance Scope</title> 
          <para>It is understandable that much of the response time may
            be due to factors outside the control of Orca (e.g., Bonobo
            and the underlying speech engine).  As such, the primary
            responsibility of Orca and each application script is to
            process AT-SPI and keyboard events as quickly as possible.

    <section id="urdocs"><title>Documentation and Tutorials</title>
      <para> Although it is a reasonable goal that Orca should attempt
        to achieve, users cannot be expected to be able set up and use
        Orca without documentation.  Like other systems, such as JAWS,
        Orca must provide documentation and tutorials on the
        installation, configuration and use of Orca.  This
        documentation must come in form(s) that are accessible to
        people who need to use the screen reader (e.g., accessible
        text and audio).</para>
