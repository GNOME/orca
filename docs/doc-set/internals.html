      components, such as AT-SPI, ATK, GAIL, gnome-speech, gnome-mag,
      and GTK+, Orca is only supported on the release of GNOME with
      which it was released.  For example, Orca v2.22.0 was released
      with GNOME 2.22.0 and is only supported on GNOME 2.22.0.  To

    User Experience Design.  There are two primary operating modes
    of Orca: a focus tracking mode and a flat review mode.</p><p>The focus tracking mode is the preferred mode of operation.
    It generally relies upon applications to provide reasonable
    keyboard navigation techniques to allow the user to operate the
    application without requiring the mouse.  As the user uses
    traditional keyboard navigation techniques to move from component
    to component in the application (e.g., pressing the Tab key to
    move from pushbutton to text area to toggle button, etc.), Orca
    will present this to the user via braille, speech,
    or a combination thereof.  In the cases where more complex
    navigation is needed, such as structural navigation of complex
    text documents, Orca also provides a facility to define keyboard
    and braille input events that it can intercept and handle
    appropriately.</p><p>The flat review mode provides the user with the ability to
    spatially navigate a window, giving them the ability to explore as
    well as discover and interact with components in the window. This
    mode is not a preferred mode, but is instead intended to allow a
    user to interact with ill-behaved applications.  Orca provides a
    default set of keybindings for flat review, and these keybindings
    can be easily redefined by the user.</p><p>The focus tracking mode of Orca is handled by "scripts,"
    which are Python modules that can provide a custom interpretation
    of an application's interaction model.  It is not intended that
    there will be a unique script for every application.  Instead, it
    is expected that there will be a general purpose "default" script
    that covers a large number of applications.  In the event that
    more compelling or custom behavior is desired for an application,
    however, one can use a custom script for the application.
    Furthermore, scripts can subclass other scripts, allowing them to
    be quite simple. In practice, all the custom scripts extend the
    "default" script.</p><p>As illustrated in the high level Orca architecture diagram,
    the main components of Orca are as follows: desktop applications
    that support the AT-SPI, the AT-SPI registry and infrastructure,
    Orca itself, Orca Scripts, and system services (e.g., speech,
    braille).</p><div class="figure"><a name="id2489678"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.1. High Level Orca Architecture. The main components of Orca

      Scripts, and system services.  The key communication between the
      components is depicted.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="architecture.png" alt="High Level Orca Architecture"></div></div><p>The following sections describe the architecture in more
    detail.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="archdesktop"></a>Desktop and AT-SPI</h2></div></div></div><p>Orca's sole view of any application on the desktop is via
      the AT-SPI [<span class="citation"><a href="#at-spi">AT-SPI</a></span>].  The AT-SPI is an
      IDL/CORBA/Bonobo-based
      technology [<span class="citation"><a href="#bonobo">Bonobo</a></span>] that provides a common
      interface for the desktop and its applications to expose their
      GUI component hierarchy to assistive technologies such as Orca.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE:</em></span> the AT-SPI infrastructure is being migrated to D-Bus for
      GNOME 3.0.  This migration should have little impact on the
      architecture or code of Orca.  In other words, do you worry
      'bout a thing.</p><p>AT-SPI support is provided by toolkits such as GNOME's
      GTK+ toolkit (via GAIL [<span class="citation"><a href="#gail">GAIL</a></span>]), the Java platform (via the
      Java access bridge), and the custom toolkits used by
      applications such as Mozilla and Open Office.  Future support
      includes the Qt toolkit of KDE.</p><p>Assistive Technologies interact with the AT-SPI via two
      primary means: the AT-SPI registry and accessible objects.  The
      AT-SPI registry permits assistive technologies to discover
      existing applications on the desktop and to register for event
      notification for AT-SPI events (e.g., window creation, focus
      changes, object state changes, etc.) and device events (e.g.,
      keyboard input events).  Accessible objects provide the
      assistive technology with information about the application, and
      tend to mirror the actual GUI component hierarchy.  Accessible
      objects can be obtained in three ways: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>From the AT-SPI registry via queries on the desktop</p></li><li><p>From an AT-SPI event</p></li><li><p>From another Accessible via parent/child relationships
            and other relationships such as "label for" and 
	    "labeled by".</p></li></ol></div><p>Orca's interaction with the AT-SPI is managed through the
      <code class="literal">pyatspi</code> module that is part of AT-SPI.  The
      <code class="literal">pyatspi</code> module communicates directly with
      the AT-SPI number of classes that help with AT-SPI interaction.
      The best ways to learn AT-SPI are as follows:

      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Read the AT-SPI interface documentation.</p></li><li><p>Run the <code class="literal">accerciser</code> application to
          examine the accessibility information of desktop
          applications.  This includes analyzing the accessible
          hierarchy as well as watching events that are issued as
          you interact with desktop applcations.</p></li><li><p>Enable the debug mode of Orca as described on the
          <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Debugging" target="_top">Orca
          WIKI</a>.  Run Orca and interact with an
          application. Then, quit Orca and analyze the debug
          log.</p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>As illustrated in the high level Orca architecture
      diagram, the <code class="literal">pyatspi</code> module has been used to
      register event and device listeners with the AT-SPI registry.
      Each exemplary desktop application (Firefox, Evolution, Pidgin,
      and OpenOffice) emits AT-SPI events to the AT-SPI registry which
      then delivers them to the <code class="literal">pyatspi</code> module.
      The <code class="literal">pyatspi</code> module then calls all appropriate
      listeners for the events it receives from the AT-SPI
      registry.</p><p>In this case, the <code class="literal">orca.orca</code> module
      receives keyboard events, which it interprets and also sends on
      to a single instance of the
      <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code> class (not depicted
      in the illustration).  Of more
      interest, however, is that the
      <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      instance receives AT-SPI events which it then passes on the
      script instance for the application associated with the event.
      If there is no script instance,
      the <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      will create an instance of
      the <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> class.  See the
      <a href="#scriptguide" title="Chapter 3. Introduction to Scripting">Orca Script Writing Guide</a> for more information.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:</em></span> Because processing AT-SPI object events can be
      time consuming, and because the notification of AT-SPI object
      events is relatively "bursty," the
      <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      class maintains a queue of AT-SPI object and input device
      events. It adds the events to this queue when it receives them
      and processes the events on the GLib idle handling thread.  This
      permits Orca to survive a relatively long burst of events and
      also allows it to handle the events on a thread that is
      compatible with GLib.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="archorca"></a>Orca Module</h2></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">orca.orca</code> module is the "main entry
      point" of Orca.  It initializes the components that Orca uses
      (pyatspi, speech, braille, mag) and loads the user's settings.
      It also is the first to receive all keyboard and braille input
      events and delves them out to other Orca components
      appropriately.</p><p>The <code class="literal">orca.orca</code> module maintains the
      current known "locus of focus"
      in <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.locusOfFocus</code>.  The
      <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.locusOfFocus</code> field is
      intended to represent the current object that the user is
      working with.  In simple terms, it is the object that is
      highlighted or has the dotted line drawn around it.  Be advised
      that the notion of "focus" differs from toolkit to toolkit.  For
      example, the object with toolkit focus may actually be the
      parent of the object that is highlighted.  As such,
      the <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.locusOfFocus</code> field is an
      an attempt to neutralize these differences across toolkits: the
      locus of focus is the individual object that is highlighted, has
      the caret, etc.</p><p>Orca scripts
      set <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.locusOfFocus</code> to inform
      Orca when the locus of focus has changed.  In addition, in the
      event that there was a visual appearance change to the object
      that has the locus of focus, the <code class="literal">orca.orca</code>
      module provides a <code class="literal">visualAppearanceChanged</code>
      method that scripts can use to inform Orca of this event.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE:</em></span> The <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.locusOfFocus</code>
      field is intended to be set only via the
      <code class="literal">orca.setLocusOfFocus</code> method. Because the
      <code class="literal">orca.setLocusOfFocus</code> method performs bookkeeping
      and other tasks, the
      <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.locusOfFocus</code> field should
      never be set directly.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="archsettings"></a>settings</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">orca.settings</code> module (not depicted in
        the high level Orca architecture diagram) holds preferences
        set by the user during configuration.  These settings include
        the following: use of speech and/or braille,
        voice styles, key echo, text echo, etc.</p><p>Any Orca module can check the value of a setting by
        examining the field directly in the
        <code class="literal">orca.settings</code> module.  In addition, the
        <code class="literal">orca.orca</code> module will import the
        <code class="literal">user-settings</code> module from the
        <code class="literal">~/.orca directory</code>, if it exists.
        The <code class="literal">user-settings</code> module is

	first time Orca is used or when the user presses 
	<code class="literal">Orca+Space</code> to invoke the configuration
	GUI.</p><p>The <code class="literal">user-settings</code> module is a Python
        script, allowing it to contain functions, class definitions,
        etc.  The primary job of the
        <code class="literal">user-settings</code>, however, is to directly set
        the values of fields in the <code class="literal">orca.settings</code>
        module.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:</em></span> the <code class="literal">init</code> method of the

      support for speech synthesis, braille, and screen magnification.
      To interact with these services, Orca provides the modules
      described in the following sections.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="archspeech"></a>orca.speech</h3></div></div></div><p>All speaking operations should be done by calling
        methods in the <code class="literal">orca.speech</code> module.
        The <code class="literal">orca.speech</code> module provides Orca's Python
        interface to system speech services.  Each speech service is
        generated by a "speech server factory."  There are currently
        three such factories: one for
        [<span class="citation"><a href="#gnome-speech">gnome-speech</a></span>] (see the
        <code class="literal">orca.gnomespeechfactory</code> module), one for
        [<span class="citation"><a href="#emacspeak">Emacspeak</a></span>] (see the
        <code class="literal">orca.espeechfactory</code> module), and one for
        SpeechDispatcher (see
        the <code class="literal">orca.speechdispatcherfactory</code> module).
        Currently, the only officially supported factory is the one
        provided by the <code class="literal">orca.gnomespeechfactory</code>
        module.</p><p>Each speech factory offers up a list of
        <code class="literal">orca.speechserver.SpeechServer</code> instances
        via the <code class="literal">getSpeechServers</code> method, where each
        <code class="literal">orca.speechserver.SpeechServer</code> instance is
        typically an interface to a particular speech engine.  For
        example, the
        <code class="literal">orca.espeechfactory</code> module will offer up a
        <code class="literal">orca.espeechfactory.SpeechServer</code> that talks
        to the Fonix DECtalk engine and
        a <code class="literal">orca.espeechfactory.SpeechServer</code> that
        talks to the IBMTTS engine.  Likewise, the
        <code class="literal">orca.gnomespeechfactory</code> will offer up a
        <code class="literal">orca.gnomespeechfactory.SpeechServer</code> instance that uses the
        <code class="literal">gnome-speech</code> interface to talk to the
        eSpeak synthesis engine, a separate
        <code class="literal">orca.gnomespeechfactory.SpeechServer</code>
        instance that also uses the
        <code class="literal">gnome-speech</code> interface to talk to the Fonix
        DECtalk engine, and so on.</p><p>Each <code class="literal">orca.speechserver.SpeechServer</code>
        instance provides a set of methods for actually speaking. Many
        of the methods accepts an <code class="literal">ACSS</code> instance,
        which represents an aural cascading style sheet
        ([<span class="citation"><a href="#acss">ACSS</a></span>]) that defines the voice and
        voice parameter settings to use.</p><p>As part of the Orca setup process, the user selects a
        particular speech factory,
        <code class="literal">SpeechServer</code>, and voice to use as their
        default voice.  When Orca starts, the
        <code class="literal">orca.speech</code> module looks for these settings
        and connects to the appropriate speech factory and

    of providing a natural feeling and compelling user experience for
    the various user interaction models of different desktop
    applications.</p><p>The Orca scripting approach allows scripts to extend and/or
    override the behavior of other scripts, thus simplifying the job
    of a script writer.  To further facilitate script writing, Orca
    provides a "default" script (held in
    the <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> class) that provides a
    reasonable default behavior for Orca.  This will not only serve as
    the "fallback script" for Orca, but will also typically serve as
    the "jumping off" point for writing custom scripts.  Furthermore,
    keep in mind that the "default" script is intended to cover a
    large variety of applications.  As such, you may find that it is
    not necessary to write a custom script.</p><p>The primary and preferred operating mode of Orca is "focus
    tracking mode," where Orca keeps track of the most relevant user
    interface object that has keyboard focus.  When Orca detects
    changes to this object, which Orca refers to as the "locus of
    focus," (available as
    the <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.locusOfFocus</code> field and set via
    the <code class="literal">orca.orca.setLocusOfFocus</code> method) Orca will
    present relevant information to the user.</p><p>As such, the primary goal of a script is to assist Orca in
    tracking of the locus of focus as well as presenting information
    about the locus of focus.  A script does this by registering for
    one or more AT-SPI events and then reacting appropriately when it
    receives those events.  A script can also intercept and interpret
    keystrokes and braille input events, allowing it to further extend
    the behavior of Orca.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sgcontract"></a>Script Contract</h2></div></div></div><p>The contract for a script is documented in detail in the
      pydoc of the <code class="literal">orca.script.Script</code> class in the
      <code class="literal">orca/script.py</code> module.  The
      <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> subclass defined in the
      <code class="literal">orca/default.py</code> module provides the default
      behavior for Orca when it encounters applications and toolkits
      that behave like the GTK toolkit.  It is expected that new
      scripts will typically extend
      the <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> subclass rather than
      directly extending the <code class="literal">orca.script.Script</code>
      class.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sglifecycle"></a>Script Life Cycle</h2></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="birth"></a>Birth</h3></div></div></div><p>Orca's <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      class is the sole maintainer of scripts. Whenever it receives
      an event from the AT-SPI Registry, the
      <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      class instance will determine the application associated with
      that event and create a new script for that application if on
      has not yet been created.  A single
      <code class="literal">orca.script.Script</code> instance will be created for each
      application instance on the desktop.  For example, if two
      instances of <code class="literal">gcalctool</code> are running, the 
      <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      class instance will create a
      <code class="literal">orca.script.Script</code> instance for
      each <code class="literal">gcalctool</code> it encounters.</p><p>The script creation process consists of the following
      steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
          class tries to find the script for an application in the
          following order, using whichever it finds first:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>a script based upon the application name</p></li><li><p>a script based upon the toolkit name of the application</p></li><li><p>the <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> script</p></li></ol></div><p>The application scripts live in
          the <code class="literal">orca.scripts.apps</code> package, the
          toolkit scripts live in
          the <code class="literal">orca.scripts.toolkits</code> package, and
          the <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> class lives in
          the <code class="literal">orca/default.py</code> module.</p><p>The application name is available as
          the <code class="literal">name</code> field of the application, which
          can be obtained from the
          <code class="literal">host_application</code> field of an event or
          the <code class="literal">getApplication</code> method of an accessible
	  object.</p><p>Rather than using the application name directly,
	  however, the
	  <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code> class uses
	  the <code class="literal">orca.settings.getScriptModuleName</code> method.
	  This method provides a convenience mechanism to map an
	  application name to a script module name, allowing the
	  mapping of names containing illegal module name characters
	  as well as the mapping of names for applications that
	  frequently change their name.  By default, the method just
	  uses application name for the module name, but the behavior
	  can be overridden using
	  the <code class="literal">orca.settings.setScriptMapping</code>
	  method.  For example, the application name of "gcalctool"
	  can be directly mapped
	  to <code class="literal">orca/scripts/apps/gcalctool.py</code> whereas
	  the application names of "Bon Echo", "Minefield",
	  "Shiretoko", "Firefox", and whatever other personalities the
	  Firefox web browser chooses to emit will be mapped to
	  the <code class="literal">orca/scripts/apps/Mozilla.py</code>
	  module via calls to <code class="literal">setScriptMapping</code>
          by the <code class="literal">orca.settings</code> module itself.</p><p>If a custom script is not available for the specific
          application,
          the <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
          class will search for a toolkit script using
          the <code class="literal">toolkitName</code> of the
          application.</p><p>Failing the existence of an application-specific or
          toolkit-specific script,
          the <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code> class
          will create an instance of
          the <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> class defined in
          the <code class="literal">orca/default.py</code> module.</p><p>For example, for the <code class="literal">gnome-terminal</code>
          application, the
          <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code> will look for
          the <code class="literal">gnome-terminal.py</code> in the
          <code class="literal">orca.scripts.apps</code> package.  If it cannot
          find such a module in the Python search path, the
          <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
          class will then check in
          the <code class="literal">orca.scripts.toolkits</code> package for a
          module matching the <code class="literal">toolkitName</code> of the
          application.  Failing that, Orca will create an instance of
          the
          <code class="literal">orca.default.Script</code> class defined in the
          <code class="literal">orca/default.py</code> module.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:</em></span> it is possible to tell Orca to bypass all
          custom script creation by setting
          <code class="literal">orca.settings.enableCustomScripts=False</code>

          or <code class="literal">~/.orca/orca-customizations.py</code>
          modules.  This can be useful for debugging purposes.</p></li><li><p>Each script module is expected to define a

          the <code class="literal">orca.Script</code> class defined in the
          <code class="literal">orca/script.py</code> module.  The constructor
          takes the accessible application object as an
          argument.</p><p>The constructor for the <code class="literal">Script</code>
          instance is expected to define any keystrokes, braille
          buttons, and AT-SPI event listeners it is interested in
          (see the <a href="#customization" title="Chapter 4. Customized Behavior">Customized

            <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
            class will register event listeners for all AT-SPI events
            associated with script (i.e., the script should not
            register these events itself).  When the
            <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
            class receives an event, it will pass the event to the
            script instance associated with the event, regardless if
            the application associated with the script has focus or
            not.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:</em></span> the

          class registers its own <code class="literal">_enqueueEvent</code>
          method as the main AT-SPI event listener for all of Orca.
          This method finds (and creates if necessary) the script
          associated with the event and passes the event onto the
          required
          <code class="literal">processObjectEvent</code> method of the script
          for processing.  The event is an instance of
          the <code class="literal">pyatspi.Event</code> class.  You should

          if you plan on becoming a script writer for Orca.  Training
          and documentation of those projects are out of the scope of
          this document; you should refer to the documentation of
          those projects to learn more about them. <span class="emphasis"><em>TODO:</em></span> provide
          reference to pyatspi.</p></li><li><p>The <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
          class also keeps track of the active script, as determined
          by the script associated with the currently active window,
          and will pass all keyboard and braille input events to the
          active script.  Thus, while all other types of events go to
          the script for the application which generated the event,
          all input devices events go to the active script.  The
          current active script can be found as
          <code class="literal">orca.orca_state.activeScript</code>.  When the
          <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
          changes the active script, it calls
          the <code class="literal">activate</code> method of the new active
          script and the <code class="literal">deactivate</code> of the script
          that used to be the active script.  A script can also tell

      match AT-SPI event types (e.g., <code class="literal">focus</code>,
      <code class="literal">object:text-caret-moved</code>, etc.), and the
      values are script functions to handle the event. A script's
      constructor can modify/extend this dictionary by merely creating
      a <code class="literal">getListeners</code> method that creates this
      dictionary and overrides or adds a new entry.  An example based
      upon the <code class="literal">orca/scripts/apps/pidgin/script.py</code> for
      the Pidgin application is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">
...
import orca.scripts.default as default
...
class Script(default.Script):
...
def getListeners(self):
    """Add in an AT-SPI event listener "object:children-changed:"
    events, for this script.
    """

    listeners = default.Script.getListeners(self)
    listeners["object:children-changed:"] = self.onChildrenChanged

    return listeners
...
</pre><p>As described previously, the
      <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      class will register listeners on behalf of a script, and will
      notify the script of any events via the script's
      <code class="literal">processObjectEvent</code> method.  The
      <code class="literal">processObjectEvent</code> method of the top level
      <code class="literal">orca.script.Script</code> class examines the
      <code class="literal">event.type</code> field of
      a <code class="literal">pyatspi.Event</code>, calling any matching
      functions from the <code class="literal">listeners</code> dictionary.  As
      such, it is unlikely that
      a <code class="literal">orca.script.Script</code> subclass will ever need
      to override the <code class="literal">processObjectEvent</code> method.
      Instead, it merely needs to populate the
      <code class="literal">listeners</code> dictionary as appropriate in
      a custom <code class="literal">getListeners</code> method.</p><p>The function for an event listener merely takes an
      <code class="literal">pyatspi.Event</code> instance and does whatever it
      wants; the return value is ignored.  For example, the function
      definition associated with the above
      <code class="literal">listeners</code> entry might look like the
      following:</p><pre class="programlisting">

            provides a hint to the speech generator about how much
            text to generate.  For example, if a check box that
            already has focus is to be spoken, usually the reason
            for this is that the state changed between checked and
            unchecked.  As a result, an appropriate thing to do in
            this situation is to only speak the new change in
            state (e.g., "checked").</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">getSpeechContext(obj,

            spoken that describe the visual context of the given
            accessible object.  This is loosely represented by the
            hierarchical relationship of the object (i.e., the "Quit"
            button in the "File" menu in the ...), and the amount of
            information can be contained by specifying an accessible
            <code class="literal">stopAncestor</code> above which we do not want
            to know anything about.  The primary use of this method is
            to provide the user with feedback regarding the relevant
            visual context information that changed when the locus of
            focus changes, but this method is also useful for
            assisting in "where am I" queries.</p></li></ul></div><p>Custom scripts which want to override the behavior of
        the default speech generator can create their own speech
        generator.  Internally,
        the <code class="literal">orca.speechgenerator.SpeechGenerator</code>
        class obtains the speech for an object based upon the object's
        role.  It does so by creating and using a table
        called <code class="literal">speechGenerators</code>.  The keys for the
        table are <code class="literal">pyatspi</code> roles such
        as <code class="literal">pyatspi.ROLE_CHECK_BOX</code> and the values
        are a function in the script.  As such, the typical thing a

      <code class="literal">orca/debug.py</code>) of Orca provide a means
      for selectively turning on information to be sent to the
      console where Orca is running.  This information is quite
      useful in determining what is happening inside Orca as well as
      what the AT-SPI is sending to Orca.</p><p>Let's begin the discussion of the debug utilities with the
      top question on any script writer's mind: "What do I name my
      script?"  As you may recall, the name of a script is based
      upon the name of the application as given to us by the AT-SPI.
      One of the easy ways to determine this is to listen for
      <code class="literal">window:activate</code> events that will be issued
      when an application is started.  These events can then be used
      to determine the name of the application.</p><p>Fortunately, the
      <code class="literal">focus_tracking_presenter</code> already registers
      for <code class="literal">window:activate</code> events, so all you need
      to do is tell Orca to print these events out when it receives
      them.  The method for doing this involves telling the debug
      utilities what to do, and this can be done by modifying your
      <code class="literal">~/.orca/user-settings.py</code> or creating
      <code class="literal">~/.orca/orca-customizations.py</code>.  The
      <code class="literal">~/.orca/user-settings.py</code> file is overwritten
      each time you save your Orca preferences when running the
      Orca preferences GUI, so you might be best off creating
      <code class="literal">~/.orca/orca-customizations.py</code>, which is left
      untouched.</p><p>The most common method for enabling debugging is to 
      change two settings in <code class="literal">orca.debug</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">
import orca.debug
orca.debug.debugLevel = orca.debug.LEVEL_ALL
orca.debug.debugFile = open(time.strftime('/tmp/debug-%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S.out'), 'w', 0) 
</pre><p>These two lines will tell Orca to send very detailed debug
      information to a file under the <code class="literal">/tmp</code>
      directory.  The filename will begin
      with <code class="literal">debug</code> end in <code class="literal">.out</code>,
      and there will be a timestamp in between.  With these lines in
      place, this file be created whenever you run
      the <code class="literal">orca</code> command.</p><p>If you run Orca and give focus to the application you are
      interested in, you a <code class="literal">window:activate</code> event
      will be sent to the debug file.  For example, if you
      run <code class="literal">gcalctool</code>, you should see output similar
      to the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
vvvvv PROCESS OBJECT EVENT window:activate vvvvv
OBJECT EVENT: window:activate                          detail=(0,0)
    app.name='gcalctool' name='Calculator' role='frame' state='active enabled resizable sensitive showing visible' relations=''
</pre><p>The string <code class="literal">app.name='gcalctool'</code>
      indicates the name of the application.  As such, if you wanted
      to write a custom script, you would call it
      <code class="literal">gcalctool</code>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE:</em></span> you can also get other information while Orca is
      running by pressing the debug keystrokes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><code class="literal">Orca+Control+Alt+End</code>: dump a list
	  of all applications to the console and debug log</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">Orca+Control+Alt+Home</code>:

	    entire widget hierarchy of the application with focus to

      each of which is described in more detail in
      <code class="literal">orca/debug.py</code>.  Note that each method
      includes a debug level threshold.
      The <code class="literal">orca/debug.py</code> module has a description of
      various level settings and what to expect for output.  A few of
      the interesting methods are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><code class="literal">orca.debug.printException(level)</code>:
          if an exception is caught, this can be used to print out
          detail about it</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">orca.debug.printStack(level)</code>:
          prints the current stack; useful for determining when and
          why a code path is being executed</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">orca.debug.println(level, text)</code>:
          prints the given text; useful for general debug
          output</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">orca.debug.getAccessibleDetails(obj)</code>:
          obtains a string describing the name, description, state,
          roles, etc., for the given <code class="literal">pyatspi.Accessible</code>.
          This can be sent to <code class="literal">orca.debug.println</code>,
          for example.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE:</em></span> One debug level of interest is
      <code class="literal">debug.LEVEL_FINE</code>.  This level will tell you
      when a script is activated, and can be useful to determine if
      Orca is actually finding your script.  For example, when the
      script for the <code class="literal">gnome-terminal</code> is activated by
      the <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>,
      you will see the following output in the debug output:</p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre><p>Notice that the class of the script instance is included.
      If you determine that this class is not what you expect when
      you are developing your custom script, then something went
      wrong when trying to find or load your custom script.  This
      can often happen because Python performs a lot of late binding
      and compilation, thus errors are often not encountered until a
      specific code path is executed at run time.  You can tell the
      <code class="literal">orca.focus_tracking_presenter.FocusTrackingPresenter</code>
      to give you more information about any possible failures or
      exceptions it handles in this area by setting the debug level
