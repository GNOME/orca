>Orca is a flexible, extensible, and powerful assistive
  technology that provides end-user access to applications and
  toolkits that support the AT-SPI (e.g., the GNOME desktop).  With
  early input and continued engagement from its end users, Orca has
  been designed and implemented by the Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
  Accessibility Program Office.</P
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>NOTE:</I
> Orca is currently a work in progress.  As a result, this
  and other books in the Orca Documentation Series are under
  continuous modification and are also in various states of
  completeness.</P

>Introduction</H1
><P
>The development of Orca focused primarily on the
      requirements of its end users.  Orca's users may require
      non-visual access methods such as speech and/or braille and they
      may also require alternative visual access methods such as
      magnification.</P
><P
>When designing Orca, its authors at Sun Microsystems engaged
      the user community from the start, soliciting feedback on questions
      such as the following:</P

><P
>The Orca user personas are intended to be a tool that helps
      elicit use cases and <A
HREF="#USER_REQUIREMENTS"

>.  The approach
      is to think of "real" users with specific disabilities
      performing specific actions.  These personas are meant to cover
      a range of typical users, both in the tasks they want to
      accomplish as well as their disabilities.  The Orca user design
      explored four personas, each of which is discussed in the
      following sections:</P

></H2

        typically performs the tasks outlined in the following
        sections.</P
><DIV

><P
>Lee edits a program module in NetBeans.  Over the course
          of this editing, Lee must be able to do the following:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Determine proper indenting.  On the braille display,
              Orca shows this by using blank spaces.  Orca also has an
              option to compress horizontal spacing so as to better make
              use of braille real-estate.</P
><P
>Lee sometimes uses speech as well, and uses separate
              commands to have Orca read the indentation level.  When in
              focus tracking mode, Lee also has the option to turn on
              the automatic speaking of this information.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>See highlighting, attributes and coloring.  On the
              braille display, Orca shows this in status cells, where
              the status cells reflect the attributes of the character
              under the current cursor position.  For braille displays
              without status cells, attribute information is shown using
              dots 7 and 8, where a "key on the braille display" is used
              to cycle through the various attribute types (underline,
              bold, etc.).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Navigate to and activate buttons and other controls
              with the braille display, especially those that cannot
              gain focus using native keystrokes.  For example, some
              code completion and information windows may not have this
              ability.  Lee uses
              functions to quickly move the braille display to various
              parts of the screen such as "top of screen" or "line 6."
              This is typically done under flat review mode, and Lee uses
              the panning and navigation keys on the braille display to do
              this.</P
><P
>When Lee presses touch cursors on the braille display,
              they behave as if a Lee were performing a single left mouse
              click on the given object associated with the touch
              cursor.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Monitor an object on the screen.  When Lee tells
              Orca to monitor an object by pressing a key in
              combination with cursor routing buttons on the braille
              display Orca will reserve an area on the braille display
              and will continually display all current information for
              this object.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Set a part of the screen to jump to, such as a
              status bar.  When Lee lands on an object of interest,
              Lee will instruct Orca to reserve a keystroke by
              pressing a key and a touch cursor on the braille display
              to jump back to the object without moving the active
              focus. Since Lee is a braille user, Orca also allows Lee
              to jump to these objects by pressing a combination of a
              braille display key and touch cursor to jump to a
              bookmark (e.g., cursor 1 goes to bookmark 1).</P

          do the following:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>See all errors and warnings.  For example, when Lee
              compiles a program module, focus will be moved to a window
              containing errors and warnings.  Focus tracking should
              behave properly here, and the braille display will show
              the first line in the errors and warnings window.</P
><P
>When Lee has speech enabled, Orca will speak the first
              line of the message window.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Click on an error with a touch cursor to go to the
              error.  This acts just like performing a left mouse click
              on the error to take Lee to the editor window and source
              line for the error.  Focus tracking behaves properly here,
              and the braille display will show the line containing the
              error.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>When reviewing the screen, Orca compresses white
              space on the braille display to allow Lee to review more
              quickly.  For example, when there are only blanks to the
              right and Lee presses the pan-right button on the
              braille display, Orca will take Lee to beginning of the
              next non-blank line.  Orca also indicates positional
              information by displaying optional "beginning of line"
              and "end of line" characters which are standard well
              known characters on the braille display.  Orca also
              optionally shows vertical screen position in status
              cells.  Orca also optionally plays sound effects to
              indicate line changes.</P

><P
>Detect text selection.  When Lee selects text in the
              document, Orca uses dots 7 and 8 on the braille display to

              in context.  When spellcheck dialog comes up, Orca
              provides a well known command to say "read the word in its
              context".  Speech will speak it.  Braille will display it,

              well-behaved and let you move to the toolbar.  Others do
              not.  Orca provides a well known command that takes Lee
              to toolbar navigation mode.  Another well known command
              (e.g., escape) gets you out of this mode.</P

              mode to do this, and Orca's flat review mode also allows

              the braille display - see the braille specification
              document for more information).  Updates to text areas

>One of the primary non-visual ways to present a graphical
        display to a user is via speech synthesis.  Note that Orca
        need not be a speech synthesizer, but it must be able to drive
        one.  The most important functionality Orca needs for speech
        synthesis are as follows:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>General Synthesis</I
> -
            Orca must be able to speak an utterance (e.g., a word, a
            label, a sentence, etc.) or set of utterances (e.g., a
            paragraph or entire document).  The utterance being spoken
            must be able to interrupted at any time.</P
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:</I
> if at all possible, the synthesis engine
            should be able to tell Orca what has been spoken, allowing
            Orca to synchronize its internal data structures with what
            has been presented to the user via speech.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Voice Styles</I
> - Orca
            must be able to identify and allow the user to select
            between the voices available on the various synthesis
            engines available on the system.  In addition, Orca must
            allow the user to customize parameter settings for the
            voices, such as average pitch, speaking rate, and volume.
            The combination of {voice, pitch, rate, volume} will be
            known as a "voice style."  Orca will provide the user with
            the ability to select the voice styles to be used for
            various speaking operations (e.g., default, uppercase,
            warning, alarm, etc.), and may also provide unique "voice
            style sets" depending upon the navigation mode being used
            (e.g., focus tracking, review mode, etc.).  At a minimum,
            Orca will support a "default" style to be used for the
            majority (if not all) of the speaking operations.</P

            generally remained fixed once configured, users may
            sometimes which to speed up or slow down the presentation
            of speech.  While it is ideal that user can do this while
            the synthesis engine is speaking, such functionality is
            typically not provided by the majority of speech synthesis
            engines.  Orca must, however, allow the user to change the
            speaking rate that will be used for the next utterance,
            should the underlying engine support changes to speaking
            rate.</P

            locales.  This is an emerging area for speech synthesis
            engines, however, so Orca will support this feature if the

        mappings.</P
><P
>As with most other available screen readers, the numeric
        keypad is the primary location for Orca keystrokes.  Where
        appropriate, the keymap also provides letter-based mnemonics
        that have been carefully chosen so as to make Orca easier to
        translate into other languages.  Furthermore, the default
        mappings have been developed with a minimalist approach so as to
        allow custom scripts to override and extend the default
        keyboard behavior while reducing conflict with the default
        keybindings.</P

        have the keyboard focus.</P

        an inconvenient access method.  As appropriate, Orca's default
        keyboard mappings may change to reflect this ideal goal;
        alternatively, Orca may provide another set of keyboard
        mappings optimized for laptop use.</P

>For braille, there are two verbosity levels.  The first
          is a more verbose level for use with larger braille displays
          and for those users who are not expert with the Gnome
          desktop environment.  The second more brief mode is for
          those who are using a smaller display or who are expert with
          the Gnome environment.  With braille, Orca should always
          make an effort to show as much of the actual item with focus
          as possible, and the user should never be left with a
          completely blank display unless they are on a blank line in
          a text editor.</P
><P
>A general style for displaying braille is as follows:
          the line will be built up of several regions and an attempt
          will be made to start the most meaningful region at a given
          "homing position."  The idea behind the homing position is
          that it will be the braille cell of the user's choice (e.g.,
          the first cell of the display, the middle of the display,
          etc.) that the user can navigate to quickly.  In the event
          that the line is too long for the physical display, the
          homing position will will apply and the line will be clipped
          to the left and/or right as appropriate; the user can use
          the panning actions to view the clipped information.  The
          regions of the line follow a general pattern:</P

              grouping of objects?)</P

>label is the label of the object, usually obtained by
              the name of the object or the text of the label that
              labels the object.  Examples include "File," "OK," "First
              name:," "Volume:," etc.  The label is generally viewed as
              the most meaningful region.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>[value] (optional) is the value of the object, and varies
              depending upon the object type.  For example, "&#60;x&#62;" for a 
              check box, "70%" for a slider, and "Mike Pedersen" for a text
              field.</P

              button") or abbreviated rolenames (e.g., "chk," "mit,"
              "pbt").  Note that the rolename may also appear in
              brief mode if the role of the object is not clear from
              the label and surrounding context.</P

>The braille cursor (e.g., dots 7 and 8 on the braille
          display) will be used to indicate meaningful information as
          well.  For example, the cursor will indicate caret position
          in text areas, and the cursor will also be used to indicate
          the menu item with focus.</P
><P
>Finally, the touch cursors on the display will "do the
          right thing."  When in focus tracking mode, pressing any
          touch cursor associated with most objects will perform the
          default action for that object; the obvious exception is
          text areas, where the touch cursor will move the text caret
          to that object.  <I

>Orca is a flexible, extensible, and powerful assistive
  technology that provides end-user access to applications and
  toolkits that support the AT-SPI (e.g., the GNOME desktop).  With
  early input and continued engagement from its end users, Orca has
  been designed and implemented by the Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
  Accessibility Program Office.</P

>NOTE:</I
> Orca is currently a work in progress.  As a result, this
  and other books in the Orca Documentation Series are under
  continuous modification and are also in various states of
  completeness.</P
><P
>This book covers the architecture and functional specification 
      of Orca.  The specification was driven primarily by the functional 
      requirements, which, in turn, were driven by the Orca User Experience

>To help narrow the scope of the Orca development activity,
      Orca uses existing software where available.  For example, as
      mentioned in the requirements, Orca is a screen reader that
      needs to be able to interact with speech synthesis, braille,
      and screen magnification services, but it need not be the
      provider of such services.  Given this, Orca has the following
      dependencies.</P

        functioning AT-SPI environment is mandatory.  The AT-SPI
        provides a CORBA-based approach to detect, examine, and
        manipulate desktop and application content.  It supports the
        registration of event listeners for changes to desktop and
        application content.  Finally, the AT-SPI supports the
        registration of listeners for input device events, with an
        option for these listeners to intercept (and possibly
        consume) the events before they are processed by the desktop
        or applications on the desktop.</P

><P
>Assistive Technologies interact with the AT-SPI via two
        primary means: the AT-SPI registry and accessible objects.
        The AT-SPI registry permits assistive technologies to discover
        existing applications on the desktop and to register for event
        notification for all AT-SPI object events (e.g., window
        creation, focus changes, object state changes, etc.) and
        device events (e.g., keyboard input events).  Accessible
        objects provide the assistive technology with information
        about the application, and tend to mirror the actual GUI
        component hierarchy.  Accessible objects can be obtained in
        three ways: </P

          Orca library written in C that provides Orca's Python
          interface to the system's AT-SPI Registry.  The core module
          provides Orca with the ability to enumerate the various
          workspaces and applications running on the display, as well
          as determine the existence of various physical heads (e.g.,
          dual headed system).  The core module also gives Orca the
          ability to register/deregister listeners for AT-SPI object
          (e.g., window activation, focus changed, etc.)  and device
          (e.g., keyboard) events.  Finally, the core also provides
          Orca's interface to the Bonobo main and main_quit methods,
          allowing Orca to interact with the AT-SPI.</P

          emits AT-SPI events to the AT-SPI registry which then
          delivers them to the core module.  The core module then
          calls all appropriate listeners for the events it receives
          from the AT-SPI registry.  In this case, the orca module
          receives events to keep track of the window with focus and
          other interesting information, the a11y module (described
          below) receives events to keep its local cache of accessible
          objects up to date.  Not depicted, each application script
          also receives AT-SPI events for components associated with
          that application, regardless of whether the application has
          keyboard focus or not.</P

><P
>The Accessible class permits Orca to obtain information
          about Accessible objects as well as manipulate those objects
          (e.g., activate actions, set cursor position, etc.).  Using

          no external entity should create an Accessible using the

>When the orca script imports the orca module, it
          triggers a chain of events.  At this time, the core module
          attempts to discover and resolve the shared libraries and
          bindings it will need to interact with the AT-SPI.  This
          includes establishing Python bindings for ORBit, bonobo,
          CORBA, and AT-SPI Accessibility. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

          issued.  The failures are typically due to prerequisites not
          being found, which probably should also be handled by the
          build/install scripts.</P
><P
>After the orca script imports the orca module, it then
          initializes it by calling the module's init method.  At this
          time, the orca module initialized the a11y module which, in turn,
          initializes the core module.</P
><P
>Upon initialization, the core module discovers/activates
          the AT-SPI registry and then establishes attributes for
          the registry and desktop.  At this point, any Python object
          can then obtain the registry and desktop attributes via
          core.registry and core.desktop.</P
><P
>Once it has initialized the core module, the a11y module
          registers a number of event listeners that it will use to
          help keep its internal cache of Accessible objects
          synchronized with the actual AT-SPI accessible objects of
          the applications.</P
><P
>Once it has initialized the a11y module, the orca module
          then initializes its interaction with the kbd module as well
          as the supporting system services: speech, braille, and
          magnification.  When it initialized the kbd and braille
          modules, the orca module passes it input event listeners
          (processKeyEvent and processBrailleEvent) that will be the
          sole event listener for those modules (those listeners will
          then multiplex events out to other orca components).</P
><P
>As the last steps of initialization, the orca module
          discovers all the applications on the desktop and then
          registers AT-SPI object event listeners.  The event
          listeners are for the events necessary to help it keep track
          of all the desktop applications as well as the application
          and object with focus.  These attributes are available to
          other orca modules as the fields "apps," "focusedApp," and
          "focusedObject."</P
><P
>When the orca script has finished initializing the orca
          module, it then calls the "start" method of the orca module.
          The "start" method finds the active window on the display,
          initializes focus tracking mode, and then calls the bonobo
          main loop to begin continued interaction with the AT-SPI.
          From this point on, the orca module is driven completely
          by keyboard and braille events as well as AT-SPI registry
          events.  All keyboard events are sent to the processKeyEvent
          method of the orca module and all braille events are sent
          to the processBrailleEvent method of the orca module.
          AT-SPI object events are sent directly to the module 
          that registers for them (e.g., orca, a11y, and the
          focus tracking mechanism described below).</P

          user-settings module is a Python script, allowing it to
          contain functions, class definitions, etc.  Furthermore, the
          import of the user-settings module will cause any executable
          statements to be run, allowing the user-settings module to
          define/set fields in itself and call functions in other
          modules.  For example, the user-settings module will
          typically define the use of output mode (speech, braille,
          mag) and may also call functions in other modules, such as
          the setDebugLevel of the debug module.</P

>The getSetting method of the settings module is intended
          to discover field attribute values.  It will first look to
          the user-settings module for the field, and then fall back

          an "enterLearnMode" function as a convenience for this).
          Because the learn mode takes over the entire keyboard and
          braille display, however, the orca module has hardcoded
          the "Escape" key to exit learn mode.</P

> the "presenter" concept is experimental for
          now.  The notion of a presenter is that Orca can have
          several types of mutually exclusive interaction methods,
          such as focus tracking, flat review, and hierarchical
          navigation.  Based on the user requirements, however, it
          has been determined that the modes may not always need to
          be mutually exclusive.  As such, this architectural aspect
          of Orca may change.  At this point, however, two
          presenters exist: the focus_tracking_presenter and the
          hierarchical_presenter.  The focus_tracking_presenter is
          described in this section, and the hierarchical_presenter
          is mostly for debugging and AT-SPI object hierarchy
          exploration purposes.</P

              method.  This method registers core listeners to
              determine when windows are created and removed.  In
              addition, it finds the currently active object and
              speaks information about it.</P

              interaction method.  This method unregisters any
              listeners that may have been registered as part 
              of activation and the handling of scripts.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The focus_tracking_presenter also defines a
          processObjectEvent method that it registers with the core
          module.  The core module will call this method with any
          AT-SPI object events the focus_tracking_presenter has
          registered.  One such event is window activation events.
          When it receives a window activation event, the
          focus_tracking_presenter will attempt to locate the Script
          instance for the application associated with the event.
          If it finds the script, it will make it the "active"
          script.  If if cannot find the script, the
          focus_tracking_presenter will create a new Script instance
          for the application.  The mechanism for creating the
          script is as follows:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>In the case where the AT-SPI gives the
              focus_tracking_presenter an event associated with no
              application whatsoever, the focus_tracking_presenter
              will use a singleton instance of the Default Script
              subclass (defined in Default.py).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Otherwise, the focus_tracking_presenter will
              search for a module whose name matches the name of the
              application (e.g., "gnome-terminal").  If this module
              exists, the focus_tracking_presenter will use its
              factory method, getScript, to obtain the Script
              instance for this application. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>TODO:</I

              prone and probably should be formalized to something

><P
>If no such module exists, then the
              focus_tracking_presenter will create unique instance
              of the Default script (defined in default.py) for the

></LI
></OL

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:</I
> for debugging purposes, Orca also supports a
          useCustomScripts setting.  If True (the default), then the
          creation of script instances will follow the above
          mechanism.  If useCustomScripts is False, however, the
          focus_tracking_presenter will only instances of the Default
          Script subclass.</P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>TODO:</I
> the inconsistent delivery order and type of
          events from the various toolkits that implement the AT-SPI
          is quite troublesome.  Gnopernicus has dealt with this by
          massaging "raw" AT-SPI events into events of its own design.
          It may be desirable to roll this logic into
          focus_tracking_presenter and have it deliver massaged events
          to scripts rather than raw AT-SPI events.  Alternatively,
          each script might provide some sort of "massageEvent"
          function to do this, where the default massageEvent function
          lives in focus_tracking_presenter.</P

          Alternatively, Orca may provide a global keyboard "refresh"
          gesture that will reload all scripts in use. </P

  technology that provides end-user access to applications and
  toolkits that support the AT-SPI (e.g., the GNOME desktop).  With
  early input and continued engagement from its end users, Orca has
  been designed and implemented by the Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
  Accessibility Program Office.</P
